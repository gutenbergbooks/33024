<h2>MOODY'S STORIES</h2>


<h4>Lady Pendulum</h4>

<p>When Mr. Sankey and I were in London a lady who
attended our meetings was brought into the house in
her carriage, being unable to walk. At first she was
very skeptical; but one day she said to her servant:</p>

<p>"Take me into the inquiry room."</p>

<p>After I had talked with her a good while about her
soul she said:</p>

<p>"But you will go back to America, and it will be all
over."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said I, "it is going to last forever."</p>

<p>I couldn't make her believe it. I don't know how
many times I talked with her. At last I used the fable
of the pendulum in the clock. The pendulum figured
up the thousands of times it would have to tick, and
got discouraged, and was going to give up. Then it
thought, "It is only a tick at a time," and went on. So
it is in the Christian life&mdash;only one step at a time. That
helped this lady very much. She began to see that if
she could trust in God for a supply of grace for only one
day, she could go right on in the same way from day to
day. As soon as she saw this, she came out quite decided.
But she never could get done talking about that pendulum.
The servants called her Lady Pendulum. She had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
a pendulum put up in her room to remind her of the
illustration, and when I went away from London she
gave me a clock&mdash;I've got it in my house still.</p>


<h4>The Greater Mystery</h4>

<p>Dr. Andrew Bonar once said that, although it was a
mystery to him how sin should have come into the world,
it was still a greater mystery how God should have come
here to bear the penalty of it Himself.</p>


<h4>Never Runs Dry</h4>

<p>I remember being in a city where I noticed that
the people resorted to a favorite well in one of the parks.
I said to a man one day:</p>

<p>"Does the well never run dry?"</p>

<p>The man was drinking of the water out of the well;
and as he stopped drinking, he smacked his lips, and
said:</p>

<p>"They have never been able to pump it dry yet.
They tried it a few years ago. They put the fire-engines
to work, and tried all they could to pump the well dry;
but they found there was a river flowing right under the
city."</p>

<p>Thank God, the well of salvation can never run dry
either!</p>


<h4>He Trusted his Father</h4>

<p>A party of gentlemen in Scotland wanted to get
some eggs from a nest on the side of a precipice, and
they tried to persuade a poor boy that lived near to go
over and get them, saying they would hold him by a
rope. They offered him a good deal of money; but they
were strangers to him, and he would not go. They
told him they would see that no accident happened to
him; they would hold the rope.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>At last he said: "I will go if my father will hold
the rope."</p>

<p>He trusted his father.</p>

<p>A man will not trust strangers. I want to get
acquainted with a man before I put my confidence in
him. I have known God for forty years, and I have
more confidence in Him now than I ever had before; it
increases every year.</p>


<h4>Peace Declared</h4>

<p>When France and England were at war once a French
vessel had gone off on a long whaling voyage. When
they came back, the crew were short of water, and being
near an English port, they wanted to get water; but they
were afraid that they would be taken prisoners if they
went into that port. Some people in the port saw their
signal of distress, and sent word that they need not be
afraid, that the war was over, and peace had been
declared. But they couldn't make those sailors believe
it, and they didn't dare to go into port, although they
were out of water. At last they made up their minds
that they had better go in and surrender their cargo
and their lives to their enemies rather than perish at sea
without water; and when they got in, they found out
that what had been told them was true, that peace had
been declared.</p>

<p>There are a great many people who don't believe the
glad tidings that peace has been made by Jesus Christ
between God and man, but it is true.</p>


<h4>Sawdust or Bread</h4>

<p>If you go out to your garden and throw down some
sawdust, the birds will not take any notice; but if you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
throw down some crumbs, you will find they will soon
sweep down and pick them up.</p>

<p>The true child of God can tell the difference (so to
speak) between sawdust and bread. Many so-called
Christians are living on the world's sawdust, instead of
being nourished by the Bread that cometh down from
heaven. Nothing can satisfy the longings of the soul
but the Word of the living God.</p>


<h4>"Baby's Feeding Himself!"</h4>

<p>You know it is always regarded a great event in the
family when a child can feed itself. It is propped up at
table, and at first perhaps it uses the spoon upside down,
but by and by it uses it all right, and mother, or perhaps
sister, claps her hands and says:</p>

<p>"Just see, baby's feeding himself!"</p>

<p>Well, what we need as Christians is to be able to feed
ourselves. How many there are who sit helpless and
listless, with open mouths, hungry for spiritual things,
and the minister has to try to feed them, while the Bible
is a feast prepared, into which they never venture.</p>


<h4>Should Not Be Postponed</h4>

<p>In 1871 I preached a series of sermons on the life of
Christ in old Farwell hall, Chicago, for five nights. I
took Him from the cradle and followed Him up to the
judgment hall, and on that occasion I consider I made
as great a blunder as ever I made in my life. It was upon
that memorable night in October, and the court-house
bell was sounding an alarm of fire, but I paid no attention
to it. You know we were accustomed to hear the
fire-bell often, and it didn't disturb us much when it
sounded. I finished the sermon upon "What Shall I Do
with Jesus?" and said to the audience:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, I want you to take the question with you and
think it over, and next Sunday I want you to come back
and tell me what you are going to do with Him."</p>

<p>What a mistake! It seems now as if Satan was in my
mind when I said this. Since then I never have dared
give an audience a week to think of their salvation. If
they were lost, they might rise up in judgment against
me. "Now is the accepted time."</p>

<p>I remember Mr. Sankey singing, and how his voice
rang when he came to that pleading verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To-day the Savior calls,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For refuge fly!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The storm of Justice falls,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And death is nigh!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After the meeting we went home. I remember going
down La Salle street with a young man, and saw the
glare of flames. I said to the young man:</p>

<p>"This means ruin to Chicago."</p>

<p>About one o'clock Farwell hall was burned; soon the
church in which I had preached went down, and everything
was scattered. I never saw that audience again.</p>

<p>My friends, we don't know what may happen to-morrow,
but there is one thing I do know, and that is, if you
take the gift of God you are saved. If you have eternal
life you need not fear fire, death, or sickness. Let disease
or death come, you can shout triumphantly over
the grave if you have Christ. My friends, what are you
going to do with Him? Will you not decide now?</p>


<h4>Teaching Willie Faith</h4>

<p>Some years ago I wanted to teach my boy what faith
was and so I put him on a table. He was a little fellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
about two years old. I stood back three or four feet,
and said.</p>

<p>"Willie, jump."</p>

<p>The little fellow said, "Papa, I'se afraid."</p>

<p>I said: "Willie, I will catch you. Just look right at
me, and jump."</p>

<p>The little fellow got all ready to jump, and then
looked down again, and said, "I'se afraid."</p>

<p>"Willie, didn't I tell you I would catch you? Will
papa deceive you? Now, Willie, look me right in the
eye, and jump, and I will catch you."</p>

<p>The little fellow got all ready the third time to jump,
but he looked on the floor, and said:</p>

<p>"I'se afraid."</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you I would catch you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>At last I said: "Willie, don't take your eyes off me";
and I held the little fellow's eyes, and said, "Now,
jump; don't look at the floor;" and he leaped into my
arms.</p>

<p>Then he said to me, "Let me jump again."</p>

<p>I put him back, and the moment he got on the table
he jumped, and after that, when he was on the table
and I was standing five or six feet away I heard him cry,
"Papa, I'se coming," and had just time to rush and
catch him. He seemed to put too much confidence in
me. But you cannot put too much confidence in God.</p>


<h4>Act on Your Belief</h4>

<p>When President Lincoln signed the proclamation of
emancipation, copies of it were sent to all points along
the Northern line, where they were posted. Now, supposing
a slave should have seen a copy of that proclama<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>tion
and should have learned its contents. He might
have known the fact, he might have assented to its justice,
but if he had still continued to serve his old master
as a slave his faith in the document would not have
amounted to anything.</p>

<p>And so it is with us. A mere knowledge of the historical
events of Christ's life, or a simple intellectual
assent to His teachings and His mission, will be of no
help in a man's life unless he adds to them a trustful
surrender to the Lord's loving kindness.</p>


<h4>"Forty Miles to Liberty"</h4>

<p>A friend of mine went to teach in Natchez before the
war. He and a friend of his went out riding one Saturday
in the country. They saw an old slave coming, and
they thought they would have a little fun. They had
just come to a place where there was a fork in the road,
and there was a sign-post which read, "Forty miles to
Liberty."</p>

<p>"Sambo, how old are you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, massa. I guess I'se about eighty."</p>

<p>"Can you read?"</p>

<p>"No, sah; we don't read in dis country. It's agin
the law."</p>

<p>"Can you tell what is on that sign-post?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sah; it says forty miles to Liberty."</p>

<p>"Well, now," said my friend, "why don't you follow
that road and get your liberty? It says there, only
'forty miles to Liberty.' Now, why don't you take that
road and go there?"</p>

<p>The old man's countenance changed, and he said:
"That ar's a sham, young massa, but if it pointed up
thar," and he raised his trembling hand toward heaven,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
"to the liberty wherewith Christ makes us free, that ar
wouldn't be no sham."</p>

<p>The old slave, with all his ignorance, had even then
experienced a liberty in his own soul that these young
men, with all their boasted education, at that time knew
nothing of.</p>


<h4>The Most Important Thing</h4>

<p>A certain John Bacon, once a famous sculptor, left
an inscription to be placed on his tomb in Westminster
Abbey:</p>

<p>"What I was as an artist seemed of some importance
to me while I lived; but what I was as a believer in
Jesus Christ is the only thing of importance to me now."</p>


<h4>Taking the Wrong Boat</h4>

<p>A Methodist minister, on his way to a camp-meeting,
through some mistake took passage on the wrong boat.
He found that instead of being bound for a religious
gathering, he was on his way to a horse-race. His fellow-passengers
were betting and discussing the events,
and the whole atmosphere was foreign to his nature. He
besought the captain that he would stop his boat and let
him off at the first landing, as the surroundings were so
distasteful to him.</p>

<p>The story also goes on to relate how, on the same
occasion a sporting man, intending to go to the races,
by some mistake found himself on the wrong boat, bound
for the camp-meeting. The conversation about him was
no more intelligible to him than to the man in the first
instance, and he, too, besought the captain to stop and
let him off the boat.</p>

<p>Now what was true in these two cases is practically<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
true with every one. A true Christian is wretched where
there is no fellowship, and an unregenerate man is not
at ease where there are only Christians. A man's future
will be according to what he is here prepared for. If he
is not regenerate, heaven will have no attractions for
him. Heaven is a prepared place for a prepared people.</p>


<h4>The Best Proof</h4>

<p>"The highest proof of the infallibility of Scripture,"
said the late A. J. Gordon, "is the practical one that
we have proved it so. As the coin of the realm has
always been found to buy the amount of its face-value,
so the prophecies and promises of Scripture have yielded
their face value to those who have taken the pains to
prove them. If they have not always done so, it is
probable that they have not yet matured. There are
multitudes of Christians who have so far proved the
veracity of the Bible that they are ready to trust it without
reserve in all that it pledges for the world yet unseen
and the life yet unrealized."</p>


<h4>Have Faith.</h4>

<p>I remember a man telling me he preached for a number
of years without any result. He used to say to his
wife as they went to church that he knew the people
would not believe anything he said; and there was no
blessing. At last he saw his error; he asked God to
help him, and took courage, and then the blessing came.</p>

<p>"According to your faith it shall be unto you." This
man had expected nothing and he got just what he
expected. Dear friends, let us expect that God is going
to use us. Let us have courage and go forward, looking
to God to do great things.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<h4>Chasing His Shadow</h4>

<p>When I was a little boy I tried to catch my shadow.
I don't know if you were ever so foolish; but I remember
running after it, and trying to get ahead of it. I
could not see why the shadow always kept ahead of me.
Once I happened to be racing with my face to the sun,
and I looked over my head and saw my shadow behind
me, and it kept behind me all the way.</p>

<p>It is the same with the Sun of Righteousness. Peace
and joy will go with you while you go with your face
toward Him, but those who turn their backs on the Sun
are in darkness all the time. Turn to the light of God,
and the reflection will flash in your heart.</p>


<h4>His Minister's Bible</h4>

<p>If I have a right to cut out a certain portion of the
Bible, I don't know why one of my friends has not a
right to cut out another, and another friend to cut out
another part, and so on. You would have a queer kind
of Bible if everybody cut out what he wanted to! Every
adulterer would cut out everything about adultery; every
liar would cut out everything about lying; every drunkard
would be cutting out what he didn't like.</p>

<p>Once a gentleman took his Bible around to his minister,
and said, "That is your Bible."</p>

<p>"Why do you call it <i>my</i> Bible?" said the minister.</p>

<p>"Well," replied the gentleman, "I have been sitting
under your preaching for five years, and when you said
that a thing in the Bible was not authentic, I cut it out."</p>

<p>He had about a third of the Bible cut out; all of Job,
all of Ecclesiastes and Revelation, and a good deal
besides. The minister wanted him to leave the Bible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
with him; he didn't want the rest of his congregation to
see it. But the man said:</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I have the covers left, and I will hold on
to them."</p>

<p>And off he went holding on to the covers.</p>


<h4>Mocked by his Children</h4>

<p>When I was in St. Louis some years ago, there was
an old man who had been away off on the mountains of
an ungodly life, but in his early manhood he had known
Christ. He came into the inquiry-room, literally broken
down. About midnight that old man came trembling
before God and was saved. He wiped away his tears,
and started home.</p>

<p>Next night I saw him in the audience with a terrible
look in his face. As soon as I finished preaching, I went
to him and said:</p>

<p>"My good friend, you haven't gone back into darkness
again?"</p>

<p>Said he: "Oh, Mr. Moody, it has been the most
wretched day in my life."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"Well, this morning as soon as I got my breakfast, I
started out. I have a number of children, married, and
in this city, and they have families; and I have spent
the day going around and telling them what God has
done for me. I told them how I had tasted salvation,
with the tears trickling down my face; and, Mr. Moody,
I hadn't a child that didn't mock me!"</p>

<p>That made me think of Lot down in Sodom. It is an
awful thing for a man who has been a backslider to have
his children mock him. But it is written: "Thy back-slidings
shall reprove thee; know, therefore, and see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken
the Lord thy God."</p>


<h4>No Need to Read Them</h4>

<p>A great many people say, you must hear both sides;
but if a man should write me a most slanderous letter
about my wife, I don't think I would have to read it; I
should tear it up and throw it to the winds. Have I to
read all the infidel books that are written, to hear both
sides? Have I to take up a book that is a slander on my
Lord and Master, who has redeemed me with His blood?
Ten thousand times no! I will not touch it.</p>


<h4>Tolling the Bell</h4>

<p>I well remember how in my native village in New
England it used to be customary, as a funeral procession
left the church, for the bell to toll as many times as the
deceased was years old. How anxiously I would count
those strokes of the bell to see how long I might reckon
on living! Sometimes there would be seventy or eighty
tolls, and I would give a sigh of relief to think I had so
many years to live. But at other times there would be
only a few years tolled, and then a horror would seize
me as I thought that I, too, might soon be claimed as a
victim by that dread monster, Death. Death and judgment
were a constant source of fear to me till I realized
the fact that neither shall ever have any hold on a
child of God. In his letter to the Romans the apostle
Paul has showed, in most direct language, that there is
no condemnation for a child of God, but that he is
passed from under the power of law, and in the Epistle
to the Corinthians he tells us that "there is a natural
body, and there is a spiritual body," "and as we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the
image of the heavenly."</p>


<h4>A Father's Neglect</h4>

<p>A story has gone the round of the American press
that made a great impression upon me as a father. A
father took his little child out into the field one Sabbath,
and, it being a hot day, lie lay down under a beautiful
shady tree. The little child ran about gathering wild
flowers and little blades of grass, and coming to its
father and saying:</p>

<p>"Pretty! pretty!"</p>

<p>At last the father fell asleep, and while he was sleeping
the little child wandered away. When he awoke,
his first thought was:</p>

<p>"Where is my child?"</p>

<p>He looked all around, but he could not see him. He
shouted at the top of his voice, but all he heard was the
echo. Running to a little hill, he looked around and
shouted again. No response! Then going to a precipice
at some distance, he looked down, and there, upon
the rocks and briars, he saw the mangled form of his
loved child. He rushed to the spot, took up the lifeless
corpse, and hugged it to his bosom, and accused himself
of being the murderer of his child. While he was
sleeping his child had wandered over the precipice.</p>

<p>I thought as I read that, what a picture of the church
of God! How many fathers and mothers, how many
Christian men and women, are sleeping now while their
children wander over the terrible precipice right into the
bottomless pit! Father, mother, where is your boy to-night?</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>
<h4>Worth Ten Thousand Men</h4>

<p>Let us not give heed to gloomy and discouraging
remarks. In the name of our great Commander let us
march on to battle and to victory. There are some generals
whose name alone is worth more than a whole army
of ten thousand men. In our army in the Civil War
there were some whose presence sent a cheer all along
the line. As they passed on, cheer upon cheer went up.
The men knew who was going to lead them, and they
were sure of having success. "The boys" liked to fight
under such generals as that. Let us encourage ourselves
in the Lord, and encourage each other; then we
shall have good success.</p>


<h4>"With or Without Power"</h4>

<p>Doctor Gordon of Boston used to say that as you
passed along Washington street of that city, or Broadway,
New York, you might see stores with the card in
the window, "To rent, with or without power," and any
one could rent the store, and by paying something extra
could have power furnished from the engine in the rear.
Doctor Gordon thought it would be a good thing to ask
men and women when they joined the church if they
wanted to be a member on the "with power" or the
"without power" basis, and if the latter, to tell them
there were no vacancies for that kind in the church, it
already had too many members without power.</p>


<h4>Turning on the Tap</h4>

<p>A man who lived on the bank of Lake Erie had water
pipes laid to his house from the lake; and when he
wanted water all he had to do was to turn the tap and
the water flowed in. If the government had presented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
him with the lake he would not have known what to do
with it. So we may say that if God were to give us
grace enough for a lifetime, we should not know how to
use it. He has given us the privilege of drawing on Him
day by day&mdash;not "forty days after sight." There is
plenty of grace in the bank of heaven; we need not be
afraid of its becoming exhausted.</p>


<h4>Keep Close!</h4>

<p>The late Dr. Andrew Bonar once remarked in his
own quaint fashion that it was always easy to trace the
footprints of a person if we walked close behind him, but
if we were some distance back we might fail to find
them; and accordingly, if we followed close after the
Master we would easily see the way, but if we tried to
follow afar off we would find it difficult to know the path
of His will.</p>


<h4>On Both Knees</h4>

<p>William Dawson once told this story to illustrate how
humble the soul must be before it can find peace.</p>

<p>He said that at a revival meeting a little lad who was
used to Methodist ways, went home to his mother and
said:</p>

<p>"Mother, John So-and-so is under conviction and
seeking for peace, but he will not find it to-night,
mother."</p>

<p>"Why, William?" said she.</p>

<p>"Because he is only down on one knee, mother, and
he will never get peace until he is down on both knees."</p>

<p>Until conviction of sin brings us down on both knees,
until we are completely humbled, until we have no hope
in ourselves left, we cannot find the Savior.</p>

<h4>Something New</h4>

<p>A great many people seem to think that the Bible is
out of date, that it is an old book, that it has passed its
day. They say it was very good for the dark ages, and
that there is some very good history in it, but it was not
intended for the present time; we are living in a very
enlightened age and men can get on very well without
it; we have outgrown it.</p>

<p>Now, you might just as well say that the sun, which
has shone so long, is now so old that it is out of date,
and that whenever a man builds a house he need not put
any windows in it, because we have a newer light and a
better light; we have gaslight and electric light. These
are something new; and I would advise people, if they
think the Bible is too old and worn out, when they build
houses, not to put windows in them, but just to light
them with electric light; that is something new and that
is what they are anxious for.</p>


<h4>Bidding Christ Farewell</h4>

<p>A rule I have had for years is to treat the Lord Jesus
Christ as a personal friend. It is not a creed, a mere
empty doctrine, but it is Christ Himself we have. The
moment we receive Christ we should receive Him as a
friend. When I go away from home I bid my wife and
children good-bye; I bid my friends and acquaintances
good-bye; but I never heard of a poor backslider going
down on his knees and saying:</p>

<p>"I have been near You for ten years. Your service
has become tedious and monotonous. I have come to
bid You farewell. Good-bye, Lord Jesus Christ!"</p>

<p>I never heard of one doing this. I will tell you how
they go away; they just run away.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>
<h4>Any One Can <i>Believe</i></h4>

<p>God has put the offer of salvation in such a way that
the whole world can lay hold of it. All men can <i>believe</i>.
A lame man might not perhaps be able to visit the sick;
but he can <i>believe</i>. A blind man, by reason of his infirmity,
cannot do many things; but he can <i>believe</i>. A deaf
man can <i>believe</i>. A dying man can <i>believe</i>. God has put
salvation so simply that young and old, wise and foolish,
rich and poor, can all <i>believe</i> if they will.</p>


<h4>The Wrath of God Was on Him</h4>

<p>I heard of a rich man who was asked to make a contribution
on behalf of some charitable object. The text
was quoted to him&mdash;"He that hath pity upon the poor
lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given
will He pay him again," He said that the security
might be good enough, but the credit was too long. He
was dead within two weeks.</p>


<h4>The War was Ended</h4>

<p>During the last days of the Civil War, when many
men were deserting the Southern flag, Secretary Stanton
sent out a notice from the war department that no more
refugees should be taken into the Union army.</p>

<p>A Southern soldier who had not seen that order came
into the Union lines, and they read it to him. He didn't
know what to do. If he went back into the Southern
army he would be shot as a deserter, and the Northern
army wouldn't have him. So he went into the woods,
and stayed there, living on roots and whatever else he
could get, until finally he was starving.</p>

<p>One day he saw an officer riding by. He rushed out
of the woods, caught the horse's bridle, and said he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
would kill the officer if he didn't help him. The officer
asked what was the trouble, and he told him.</p>

<p>"But haven't you heard the news?" said the officer.</p>

<p>"No; what news?"</p>

<p>"Why, the war is over! Lee has surrendered, and
peace has been declared. Go to the nearest town and get
all the food you want."</p>

<p>The man waved his hat, and went off as fast as he
could.</p>

<p>I want to say that peace has been declared between
God and man. Be reconciled to God. The blood is on
the mercy-seat, and the vilest sinner can be saved for
time and eternity.</p>


<h4>Nearer than he Thought</h4>

<p>I was reading, some time ago, of a young man who
had just come out of a saloon, and had mounted his
horse. As a certain deacon passed on his way to church,
he followed and said:</p>

<p>"Deacon, can you tell me how far it is to hell?"</p>

<p>The deacon's heart was pained to think that a young
man like that should talk so lightly; but he passed on
and said nothing. When he came round the corner to
the church, he found that the horse had thrown that
young man, and he was dead. You, too, may be nearer
the judgment than you think.</p>


<h4>Its Strength was Underestimated</h4>

<p>Some of the older people can remember when our
Civil War broke out. Secretary Seward, who was Lincoln's
Secretary of State&mdash;a long-headed and shrewd
politician&mdash;prophesied that the war would be over in
ninety days; and young men in thousands and hundreds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of thousands came forward and volunteered to go down
to Dixie and whip the South. They thought they would
be back in ninety days; but the war lasted four years,
and cost about half a million of lives. What was the
matter? Why, the South was a good deal stronger than
the North supposed. Its strength was underestimated.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ makes no mistake of that kind. When
He enlists a man in His service, He shows him the
dark side; He lets him know that he must live a life of
self-denial. If a man is not willing to go to heaven by
the way of Calvary, he cannot go at all. Many men want
a religion in which there is no cross, but they cannot
enter heaven that way. If we are to be disciples of
Jesus Christ, we must deny ourselves and take up our
cross and follow Him. So let us sit down and count the
cost. Do not think that you will have no battles if you
follow the Nazarene, because many battles are before
you. Yet if I had ten thousand lives, Jesus Christ
should have every one of them. Men do not object to
a battle if they are confident that they will have victory,
and, thank God, every one of us may have the victory
if we will.</p>


<h4>Seeing the Gospel</h4>

<p>"Have you ever heard the Gospel?" asked a missionary
of a Chinaman, whom he had not seen in his mission
before.</p>

<p>"No," he replied, "but I have seen it. I know a
man who used to be the terror of his neighborhood. He
was a bad opium smoker and dangerous as a wild beast;
but he became wholly changed. He is now gentle and
good and has left off opium."</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<h4>Illuminated Christians</h4>

<p>We see very few illuminated Christians now. If
every one of us was illuminated by the Spirit of God,
how we could light up the churches! But to have a lantern
without any light, that would be a nuisance. Many
Christians carry along lanterns and say, "I wouldn't
give up my religion for yours." They talk about religion.
The religion that has no fire is like painted fire.
They are artificial Christians. Do you belong to that
class? You can tell. If you can't, your friends can.</p>

<p>There is a fable of an old lantern in a shed, which
began to boast because it had heard its master say he
didn't know what he would ever do without it. But the
little candle within spoke up and said: "Yes, you'd be
a great comfort if it wasn't for me! You are nothing;
I'm the one that gives the light." We are nothing, but
Christ is everything, and what we want is to keep in
communion with Him and let Christ dwell in us richly
and shine forth through us.</p>

<p>I have a match box with a phosphorescent front. It
draws in the rays of the sun during the day and then
throws them out in the dead hours of the night, so that I
can always see it in the dark. Now, that is what we
ought to be, constantly drawing in the rays of the Sun of
Righteousness and then giving them out. Some one said
to some young converts, "It is all moonshine being converted."
They replied, "Thank you for the compliment.
The moon borrows light from the sun, and so we
borrow ours from the Sun of Righteousness." That is
what takes place when we have this illumination.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<h4>Not Ashamed of his Lord</h4>

<p>A young convert tried to preach in the open air; he
could not preach very well either, but he did the best he
could. Some one interrupted him and said:</p>

<p>"Young man, you cannot preach; you ought to be
ashamed of yourself."</p>

<p>Said the young man, "So I am, but I am not ashamed
of my Lord."</p>

<p>That is right. Do not be ashamed of Christ&mdash;of the
Man that bought us with His own blood.</p>


<h4>He Silenced the Devil</h4>

<p>If you find yourself getting very miserly, begin to
scatter, like a wealthy farmer in New York state I heard
of. He was a noted miser, but he was converted. Soon
after, a poor man who had been burned out and had no
provisions came to him for help. The farmer thought
he would be liberal and give the man a ham from his
smoke-house. On his way to get it, the tempter whispered
to him:</p>

<p>"Give him the smallest one you have."</p>

<p>He had a struggle whether he would give a large or a
small ham, but finally he took down the largest he could
find.</p>

<p>"You are a fool," the devil said.</p>

<p>"If you don't keep still," the farmer replied, "I will
give him every ham I have in the smoke-house."</p>


<h4>Warm the Wax!</h4>

<p>A gentleman in Ireland had a seal made for me.
"D.L.M." is on one side, and on the other, "God is love."
If I want to stamp "God is love" I would not make
much headway if the wax was hard and cold. Many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
people go to meetings, and it is as hard to make an
impression on them as in pressing a seal on hard wax.
But let the wax be warmed up and an impression is made.
If we are willing, every one of us may be sealed for the
day of redemption. "In whom ye also trusted after
that ye heard the Word of Truth, the Gospel of your salvation;
in whom also after that ye believed, ye were
sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise."</p>


<h4>Draw Nearer</h4>

<p>When I was a boy my mother used to send me out
doors to get a birch stick to whip me with, when I had
to be punished. At first I used to stand off from the
rod as far as I could. But I soon found that the whipping
hurt me more that way than any other; and so I
went as near to my mother as I could, and found she
could not strike me so hard. And so when God chastens
us let us kiss the rod and draw as near to Him as we can.</p>


<h4>The Panorama Looks Brighter</h4>

<p>"When a panorama is to pass before an audience, the
artist darkens the room in which they sit, so that the
picture may be more fully seen. So God sometimes
darkens our place on earth, puts out this light and that,
and then before our souls He makes to pass the splendors
and glories of the better land."</p>


<h4>All Things Work for Good</h4>

<p>There is one passage of Scripture which has always
been a great comfort to me. In the eighth chapter of
Romans Paul says: "All things work together for good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
to them that love God." Some years ago a child of
mine had scarlet fever. I went to the druggist's to get
the medicine, which the doctor had ordered, and told
him to be sure and be very careful in making up the
prescription. The druggist took down one bottle after
another, in any one of which there might be what would
be rank poison for my child; but he stirred them
together and mixed them up, and made just the medicine
which my child needed. And so God gives us a little
adversity here, a little prosperity there, and all works
for our good.</p>


<h4>It Takes Time</h4>

<p>Suppose I should send my little boy, five years old,
to school to-morrow morning, and when he came home
in the afternoon, say to him:</p>

<p>"Willie, can you read? can you write? can you spell?
Do you understand all about algebra, geometry, Hebrew,
Latin and Greek?"</p>

<p>"Why, papa," the little fellow would say, "how funny
you talk. I have been all day trying to learn the
A, B, C's!"</p>

<p>Suppose I should reply: "If you have not finished
your education, you need not go any more." What
would you say? Why, you would say I had gone mad!</p>

<p>There would be just as much reason in that as in the
way that people talk about the Bible. The men who
have studied the Bible for fifty years have never got
down to the depths of it yet. There are truths there
that the church of God has been searching out for
the last nineteen hundred years, but no man has yet
fathomed the depths of the ever-living stream.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>
<h4>Something God Cannot Do</h4>

<p>In Ireland, some time ago, a teacher asked a little
boy if there was anything that God could not do. The
little fellow said:</p>

<p>"Yes, He cannot see my sins through the blood of
Christ."</p>


<h4>It Seemed Too Good to be True</h4>

<p>Some time ago I read in one of the daily papers a
thing that pleased me very much. When the new administration
of President McKinley went into office some
clerks in one of the departments were promoted. One
young lady was offered a promotion, but she went to see
the secretary, General Butterworth, and said that there
was a girl sitting next to her that had a family to support.
A brother who had been supporting the family had
died, or sickened, and it had fallen upon her, and she
asked the general to let her friend that sat next to her
have the promotion in her place.</p>

<p>The general said that he had heard of such things in
other generations, but he didn't know that it would ever
happen in his generation. He was amazed to find a
person on duty in Washington that was willing to give
up her position and take a lower one, and let some one
else have it that she might be able to help her family.</p>

<p>In Colorado the superintendent of some works told me
of a miner that was promoted, who came to the superintendent,
and said:</p>

<p>"There is a man that has seven children, and I have
only three, and he is having a hard struggle. Don't
promote me, but promote him."</p>

<p>I know of nothing that speaks louder for Christ and
Christianity than to see a man or woman giving up what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
you call your rights for others, and "in honor preferring
one another."</p>


<h4>The Scarlet Thread</h4>

<p>In the British Navy there is said to be a scarlet
thread running through every line of cordage, and
though a rope be cut into inch pieces it can be recognized
as belonging to the government. So there is a
scarlet thread running all through the Bible&mdash;the whole
book points to Christ.</p>


<h4>The First "Don't Worry Club"</h4>

<p>Mrs. Sangster says that we hear a good deal in this
age, as if it were a novelty, about the futility of being
anxious, and people have established "Don't Worry
Clubs." But the first "Don't Worry Club" was begun
by our blessed Lord Himself when He said: "Take no
thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take
thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day
is the evil thereof." He bade us consider the lilies
growing in their beauty and purity without a thought,
and taught us the true way of living without care, without
solicitude, bearing all burdens lightly, and having
continual joy on our faces. Only those who have the
indwelling Christ in their hearts can walk through this
world with bright and glad looks, because they know
that, let come what may, their Father is leading them
safely.</p>


<h4>The Story Followed Him</h4>

<p>While I was at a convention in Illinois an old man
past seventy years, got up, and said he remembered but
one thing about his father, and that one thing followed
him all through life. He could not remember his death,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
he had no recollection of his funeral, but he recollected
his father one winter night taking a little chip, and with
his pocket-knife whittling out a little cross, and with the
tears in his eyes he held up that cross, telling how God
in His infinite love sent His Son down here to redeem
us, and how He had died on the cross for us. The story
of the cross followed him through life; and if we tell
children these truths, they will never forget them.</p>


<h4>The Fatal Sleep</h4>

<p>Some time ago a vessel had been off on a whaling voyage,
and had been gone about three years. The father
of one of the sailors had charge of the light-house, and
he was expecting his boy to come home. It was time
for the whaling-vessel to return. One night there came
up a terrible gale. This father fell asleep, and while he
slept his light went out. When he awoke he looked
toward the shore and saw a vessel had been wrecked.
He at once went to see if he could not yet save some one
who might be still alive. The first body that came floating
toward the shore was, to his great grief and surprise,
the body of his own boy! He had been watching for
that boy for many days. Now the boy had at last come
in sight of home, and had perished because his father
had let his light go out!</p>

<p>I thought, what an illustration of fathers and mothers
to-day that have let their lights go out! You are not
training your children for God and eternity. You do not
live as though there were anything beyond this life at
all. You keep your affections set upon things on the
earth instead of on things above, and the result is that
the children do not believe there is anything in Christianity.
Perhaps the very next step they take may take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
them into eternity; the next day they may die without
God and without hope.</p>


<h4>That Love is Spontaneous</h4>

<p>Some time ago, in an inquiry meeting, I said to a
young miss who said that she could not love God, that
it was very hard for her to love Him:</p>

<p>"Is it hard for you to love your mother? Do you
have to learn to love your mother?"</p>

<p>She looked up through her tears, and said, "No; I
can't help it; that is spontaneous."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "when the Holy Spirit kindles love
in your heart, you can not help loving God; it will be
spontaneous."</p>

<p>When the Spirit of God comes into your heart and
mine, it will be easy to love and serve God.</p>


<h4>The Summing Up of His Life</h4>

<p>A man was taken into one of our insane asylums a
few years ago from one of the Western cities. He had
resolved to be rich. How he turned every stone to
accumulate wealth! All his energy and every faculty were
pushed toward that one end. "Wealth, wealth, wealth!
money, money, money!" was his cry. At last it drove
him mad, and they took him to the mad-house, where he
threw himself into a rocking-chair, and cried:</p>

<p>"Millions of money, and in a mad-house!"</p>

<p>That was all there was of his life. Pretty short,
wasn't it? Sixty years gone, millions of money, and in
a mad-house; and he died there. That was the
summing up of his life.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
<h4>Beautiful Motion but No Progress</h4>

<p>Many people are working and working, as Rowland
Hill said, like children on a rocking-horse&mdash;it is a beautiful
motion, but there is no progress. Those who are
working for salvation are like men on a treadmill, going
round and round and round; toiling and toiling and
toiling; but nothing comes of it all. There is no progress,
and there cannot be until you have the motive
power within, till the breath of life comes from God,
which can alone give you power to work for others.</p>


<h4>Get It into Your Heart</h4>

<p>"Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not
sin against thee." An old Scotchman says: "It is a
good thing in a good place for a good purpose." Many
people have the Bible in their heads, or in their pockets;
but we need to get it down into our hearts.</p>


<h4>How the Miners were Saved</h4>

<p>In the north of England they have been digging the
coal for a century. They have gone miles and miles
away from the shaft, under the sea, and there is danger
of men getting lost. I heard of two old miners who lost
their way. Their lights went out, and they were in danger
of losing their lives. After wandering around for a
long time, they sat down, and one of them said:</p>

<p>"Let us sit perfectly quiet, and see if we cannot feel
which way the air is moving, because it always moves
toward the shaft."</p>

<p>There they sat for a long time, when all at once one
of them felt a slight touch on his cheek, and he sprang
to his feet and said:</p>

<p>"I felt it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>They went in the direction in which the air was moving,
and reached the shaft.</p>

<p>Sometimes there comes a little breath from God that
touches our souls. It may be so gentle and faint that
you barely recognize it; but if you do, do not disregard
it. Thank God that He has spoken to you, and praise
Him for it, and whatever may come do not go in the
opposite direction. Give yourself up to be led by it, and
you will come out of darkness, out of bondage, out of
sorrow, into perpetual light and joy.</p>


<h4>Receiving and Never Giving</h4>

<p>What makes the Dead Sea dead? Because it is all
the time receiving, never giving out anything. Why is
it that many Christians are cold? Because they are all
the time receiving, never giving out anything.</p>


<h4>Dumb Christians</h4>

<p>It is a very sad thing that so many of God's children
are dumb; yet it is true. Parents would think it a great
calamity to have their children born dumb; they would
mourn over it, and weep; and well they might; but did
you ever think of the many dumb children God has?
The churches are full of them; they never speak for
Christ. They can talk about politics, art, and science;
they can speak well enough and fast enough about the
fashions of the day; but they have no voice for the Son
of God.</p>


<h4>Like Siamese Twins</h4>

<p>Covetousness and stealing are almost like Siamese
twins&mdash;they go together so often. In fact we might add
lying, and make them triplets, "The covetous person
is a thief <i>in</i> the shell. The thief is a covetous person<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
<i>out</i> of the shell. Let a covetous person see something
that he desires very much; let an opportunity of taking
it be offered; how very soon he will break through the
shell and come out in his true character as a thief."
The Greek word translated "covetousness" means&mdash;an
inordinate desire of getting. When the Gauls tasted
the sweet wines of Italy, they asked where they came
from, and never rested until they had overrun Italy.</p>


<h4>Not Troubled with Doubts</h4>

<p>One of the happiest men I ever knew was a man in
Dundee, Scotland, who had fallen and broken his back
when he was a boy of fifteen. He had lain on his
bed for about forty years, and could not be moved without
a good deal of pain. Probably not a day had passed
in all those years without acute suffering. But day after
day the grace of God had been granted to him, and when
I was in his chamber it seemed as if I was as near heaven
as I could get on earth. I can imagine that when the
angels passed over Dundee, they had to stop there to
get refreshed.</p>

<p>When I saw him, I thought he must be beyond the
reach of the tempter, and I asked him: "Doesn't Satan
ever tempt you to doubt God, and to think that He is a
hard Master?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he said, "he does try to tempt me. I lie
here and see my old schoolmates driving along in their
carriages, and Satan says: 'If God is so good, why
does He keep you here all these years? You might have
been a rich man, riding in your own carriage.' Then I
see a man who was young when I was walk by in perfect
health, and Satan whispers: 'If God loved you, couldn't
He have kept you from breaking your back?'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you do when Satan tempts you?"</p>

<p>"Ah, I just take him to Calvary, and I show him
Christ, and I point out those wounds in His hands and
feet and side, and say, 'Doesn't He love me?' and the
fact is, he got such a scare there eighteen hundred years
ago that he cannot stand it; he leaves me every time."</p>

<p>That bedridden saint had not much trouble with
doubts; he was too full of the grace of God.</p>


<h4>Honey-Dew</h4>

<p>I have sometimes been in a place where the very air
seemed to be charged with the breath of God, like
the moisture in the air. I remember one time as I went
through the woods near Mount Hermon school I heard
bees, and asked what it meant.</p>

<p>"Oh," said one of the men, "they are after the <i>honey-dew</i>."</p>

<p>"What is that?" I asked.</p>

<p>He took a chestnut leaf and told me to put my tongue
to it. I did so, and the taste was sweet as honey. Upon
inquiry I found that all up and down the Connecticut
valley what they call "honey-dew" had fallen, so that
there must have been altogether hundreds of tons of
honey-dew in this region. Where it comes from I don't
know.</p>

<p>Do you suppose that this earth would be worth living
on if it were not for the dew and the rain? So a church
that hasn't any of the dew of heaven, any of the rain
that comes down in showers, will be as barren as the
earth would be without the dew and rain.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<h4>A Personal Matter</h4>

<p>"The life of Christianity," says Luther, "consists of
personal pronouns. It is one thing to say, 'Christ is a
Savior.' It is quite another to say, 'He is <i>my</i> Savior.'
The devil can say the first. Only the true Christian can
say the second."</p>


<h4>They Knew It</h4>

<p>Let me tell you how I had my eyes opened about the
theater question. I had an assistant superintendent of
a Sabbath school, a very promising young man, who
seemed to be very happy in the work. A star actor
came to the city, and he went to see him. I knew nothing
of it, but the next Sunday when he came into the
Sunday-school all over the building the boys cried out:</p>

<p>"Hypocrite! Hypocrite!"</p>

<p>The perspiration started out of every pore of my
body; I thought they were looking at me. I said to the
little newsboys:</p>

<p>"Who are you calling a hypocrite?"</p>

<p>They mentioned the assistant's name. I asked the
reason, and they said:</p>

<p>"We saw him going into the theater."</p>

<p>I had never said anything about the theater to those
children, but they saw that man going in, and called
him a hypocrite. They seemed to know it was no place
for a Christian to go. He lost his influence entirely,
withdrew from the school, and after a while gave up
Christian work altogether. He was just swept along
with the tide in Chicago and his influence was lost.</p>


<h4>Pull for the Shore</h4>

<p>A vessel was wrecked off the shore. Eager eyes were
watching and strong arms manned the life-boat. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
hours they tried to reach that vessel through the great
breakers that raged and foamed on the sand-bank, but it
seemed impossible. The boat appeared to be leaving
the crew to perish. But after a while the captain and
sixteen men were taken off, and the vessel went down.</p>

<p>"When the life-boat came to you," said a friend,
"did you expect it had brought some tools to repair
your old ship?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," was the response; "she was a total wreck.
Two of her masts were gone, and if we had stayed mending
her only a few minutes, we must have gone down
sir."</p>

<p>"When once off the old wreck and safe in the life-boat
what remained for you to do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir, but just to pull for the shore."</p>

<p>Man can't save himself. He has been wrecked by
sin, and his only safety lies in taking Jesus Christ as his
Savior.</p>


<h4>Easy, and Yet Difficult</h4>

<p>It is the easiest thing in the world to become a Christian,
and it is also the most difficult. You say: "That
is a contradiction, a paradox." I will illustrate what I
mean.</p>

<p>A little nephew of mine, a few years ago, took my
Bible and threw it down on the floor. His mother said,</p>

<p>"Charlie, pick up uncle's Bible."</p>

<p>The little fellow said he would not.</p>

<p>"Charlie, do you know what that word means?"</p>

<p>She soon found out that he did, and that he was not
going to pick up the Book. His will had come right up
against his mother's will.</p>

<p>I began to be quite interested in the struggle: I knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
if she did not break his will, he would some day break
her heart.</p>

<p>She repeated, "Charlie, go and pick up uncle's Bible,
and put it on the table."</p>

<p>The little fellow said he could not do it.</p>

<p>"I will punish you if you do not."</p>

<p>He saw a strange look in her eye, and the matter began
to get serious. He did not want to be punished, and he
knew his mother would punish him if he did not lift the
Bible. So he straightened every bone and muscle in
him, and he said <i>he could not do it</i>. I really believe the
little fellow had reasoned himself into the belief that he
could not do it.</p>

<p>His mother knew he was only deceiving himself, so
she kept him right to the point. At last he went down,
put both his arms around the Bible, and tugged away at
it; but he still said he could not do it. The truth was&mdash;he
did not want to. He got up again without lifting it.</p>

<p>The mother said, "Charlie, I am not going to talk to
you any more. This matter has to be settled; pick up
that Bible, or I will punish you."</p>

<p>At last she broke his will, and then he found it as
easy as it is for me to turn my hand. He picked up the
Bible, and laid it on the table.</p>

<p>So it is with the sinner; if you are really willing to
take the Water of Life, <span class="smcap">YOU CAN DO IT</span>.</p>


<h4>No Difference</h4>

<p>During the war, when enlisting was going on, sometimes
a man would come up with a nice silk hat on,
patent-leather boots, kid gloves, and a fine suit of
clothes; perhaps the next man who came along would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
be a hod-carrier, dressed in the poorest kind of clothes.
Both had to strip alike and put on the regimental uniform.</p>

<p>When you come and say you are not fit, haven't got
good clothes, haven't got righteousness enough to be a
Christian, remember that Christ will furnish you with the
uniform of heaven, and you will be set down at the marriage
feast of the Lamb. I don't care how black and
vile your heart may be, only accept the invitation of
Jesus Christ, and He will make you fit to sit down with
the rest at that feast.</p>


<h4>Drawing a Comparison</h4>

<p>When I was in California I went into a Sunday-school
and asked:</p>

<p>"Have you got some one who can write a plain hand?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>We got up the blackboard, and the lesson upon it
proved to be the text, "Lay up for yourselves treasures
in heaven."</p>

<p>I said, "Suppose we write upon that board some of
the earthly treasures? We will begin with 'gold.'"</p>

<p>The teacher readily put down "gold," and they all
comprehended it, for all had run to that country in hope
of finding it.</p>

<p>"Well, we will put down 'houses' next and then 'land.'
Next we will put down 'fast horses.'"</p>

<p>They all understood what fast horses were&mdash;they
knew a good deal more about fast horses than they knew
about the kingdom of God. Some of them, I think, actually
made fast horses serve as gods.</p>

<p>"Next we will put down 'tobacco.'" The teacher
seemed to shrink at this. "Put it down," said I;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
"many a man thinks more of tobacco than he does of
God. Well, then we will put down 'rum.'"</p>

<p>He objected to this&mdash;didn't like to put it down at all.</p>

<p>"Down with it! Many a man will sell his reputation,
his home, his wife, his children, everything he has, for
rum. It is the god of some men. Many here are ready
to sell their present and their eternal welfare for it. Put
it down," and down it went.</p>

<p>"Now," said I, "suppose we put down some of the
heavenly treasures. Put down 'Jesus' to head the list,
then 'heaven,' then 'River of Life,' then 'Crown of
Glory'," and went on until the column was filled, and
then just drew a line and showed the heavenly and the
earthly things in contrast.</p>

<p>My friends, they could not stand comparison. If a
man does that, he cannot but see the superiority of the
heavenly over the earthly treasures.</p>

<p>It turned out that this teacher was not a Christian.
He had gone to California on the usual hunt&mdash;gold; and
when he saw the two columns placed side by side, the
excellence of the one over the other was irresistible, and
he was the first soul God gave me on that Pacific coast.
He accepted Christ, and that man came to the station
when I was coming away and blessed me for coming to
that place.</p>


<h4>A Legend about Doves</h4>

<p>There is a beautiful legend about a conference held
by the doves to decide where they should make their
abode. One suggested that they should go to the woods;
but the objection was made that there they would be in
danger from hawks; another mentioned the cities, but
boys would stone them there, and drive them away or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
kill them. Presently some dove suggested that they
go and hide in the clefts of the rocks, and there they
were safe. "O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities
and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove that maketh
her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rock of Ages, cleft for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me hide myself in thee.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h4>Look to Christ!</h4>

<p>A leading surgeon I heard of, when he has a bad
wound to dress, or a broken limb to set, tells the patient:</p>

<p>"Now, look at the wound, see just how it looks, and
then look at me!"</p>

<p>So when you have seen the state your heart is in,
look up to Christ, and nowhere else.</p>


<h4>Paying Attention to the Preacher</h4>

<p>There was an architect in Chicago who was converted.
In giving his testimony, he said he had been in the habit
of attending church for a great many years, but he could
not say that he had really heard a sermon all the time.
He said that when the minister gave out the text and
began to preach, he used to settle himself in the corner
of the pew and work out the plans of some building. He
could not tell how many plans he had prepared while the
minister was preaching. He was the architect for one
or two companies; and he used to do all his planning in
that way.</p>

<p>You see, Satan came in between him and the preacher,
and caught away the good seed of the Word. I have
often preached to people, and have been perfectly
amazed to find they could hardly tell one solitary word
of the sermon; even the text had completely gone from
them.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>
<h4>Better Make Sure</h4>

<p>"I hab hearn folks say, 'Hope I has 'ligion, but I
doan know'; but I neber hearn a man say, 'I hope's I
has money, but I doan know.' Dat sorter 'ligion dat
yer hopes ye's got, but doan know, ain't gwine to do
no mo' good dan der money what yer hopes ye's got but
doan know."</p>


<h4>Some Things Quite Plain</h4>

<p>An English army officer in India who had been living
an impure life went round one evening to argue religion
with the chaplain. During their talk the officer said:</p>

<p>"Religion is all very well, but you must admit that
there are difficulties&mdash;about the miracles, for instance."</p>

<p>The chaplain knew the man and his besetting sin, and
quietly looking him in the face, answered:</p>

<p>"Yes; there are some things in the Bible not very
plain, I admit; but the seventh commandment is very
plain."</p>


<h4>Your Own Picture There</h4>

<p>The Bible is like an album. I go into a man's house,
and while waiting for him, I take up an album and open
it. I look at a picture. "Why, that looks like a man
I know." I turn over and look at another. "Well, I
know that man." I keep turning over the leaves. "Well,
there is a man who lives in the same street as myself&mdash;he
is my next-door neighbor." And then I come upon
another, and see myself.</p>

<p>My friends, if you read your Bibles you will find your
own pictures there. It just describes you. You may be
a Pharisee; if so, turn to the third chapter of John, and
see what Christ said to the Pharisee: "Except a man
be born again he cannot enter the kingdom of God."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
But you may say: "I am not a Pharisee; I am a poor
miserable sinner, too bad to come to Him." Well, turn
to the woman of Samaria, and see what Christ said to
her.</p>


<h4>"That's Me!"</h4>

<p>While we were in London, Mr. Spurgeon one day in his
orphanage told about the boys&mdash;that some of them had
aunts and some cousins, and that nearly every boy had
some friend that took an interest in him, and came to
see him and gave him a little pocket money. One day,
he said, while he stood there, a little boy came up to
him and said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Spurgeon, let me speak to you."</p>

<p>The boy sat down between Mr. Spurgeon and the
elder who was with him, and said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Spurgeon, suppose your father and mother were
dead, and you didn't have any cousins, or aunts, or
uncles or friends to come and give you pocket money,
and give you presents, don't you think you would feel
bad? Because that's me!"</p>

<p>Said Mr. Spurgeon: "The minute he said that, I put
my right hand down into my pocket and took out some
money for him."</p>


<h4>Queer Ideas of Repentance</h4>

<p>The unconverted have a false idea about repentance;
they think God is going to make them repent. I was
once talking with a man on this subject, and he summed
up his whole argument by saying:</p>

<p>"Moody, it has never struck me yet."</p>

<p>I said: "What has never struck you."</p>

<p>"Well," he replied: "Some people it strikes, and
some it doesn't. There was a good deal of interest in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
our town a few years ago, and some of my neighbors
were converted, but it didn't strike me."</p>

<p>That man thought that repentance was coming down
some day to strike him like lightning. Another man
said he expected some sensation, like cold chills down
his back.</p>

<p>Repentance isn't feeling. It is turning from sin to
God. One of the best definitions was given by a soldier.
Some one asked him how he was converted. He
said:</p>

<p>"The Lord said to me, <i>Halt! Attention! Right about
face! March!</i> and that was all there was in it."</p>


<h4>A Good Illustration</h4>

<p>A little child gives a good illustration of faith. Let
the wind blow her hat into the river, and she does not
worry; she knows her mother will get her another. She
lives by faith.</p>


<h4>"Come! Come! Come!"</h4>

<p>A man in one of our meetings had been brought there
against his will; he had come through some personal
influence brought to bear upon him. When he got to
the meeting, they were singing the chorus of a hymn:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come! oh, come to Me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come! oh, come to Me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weary, heavy-laden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come! oh, come to Me!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He said afterward he thought he never saw so many
fools together in his life before. The idea of a number
of men standing there singing, "Come! come! come!"</p>

<p>When he started home he could not get this little
word out of his head; it kept coming back all the time.
He went into a saloon, and ordered some whisky, think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>ing
to drown it. But he could not; it still kept coming
back. He went into another saloon, and drank some
more whisky; but the words kept ringing in his ears:
"Come! come! come!" He said to himself, "What a
fool I am for allowing myself to be troubled in this way!"
He went to a third saloon, had another glass, and finally
got home.</p>

<p>He went off to bed, but could not sleep; it seemed as
if the very pillow kept whispering the word, "Come!
Come!" He began to be angry with himself: "What
a fool I was for ever going to that meeting at all!"
When he got up he took the little hymn book, found the
hymn, and read it over.</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" he said to himself; "the idea of a
rational man being disturbed by that hymn."</p>

<p>He set fire to the hymn book, but he could not burn
up the little word "Come!"</p>

<p>He declared he would never go to another of the
meetings; but the next night he came again. When he
got there, strange to say, they were singing the same
hymn.</p>

<p>"There is that miserable old hymn again," he said;
"what a fool I am for coming!" When the Spirit of
God lays hold of a man, he does a good many things he
did not intend to do.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, that man rose in a meeting
of young converts, and told the story that I have
now told you. Pulling out the little hymn-book&mdash;for he
had bought another copy&mdash;and opening it at this hymn,
he said:</p>

<p>"I think this hymn is the sweetest and the best in the
English language. God blessed it to the saving of my
soul. And yet this was the very hymn that I despised."</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>
<h4>Don't Scold</h4>

<p>"He that winneth souls is wise." Do you want to
win men? Do not drive or scold them. Do not try to
tear down their prejudices before you begin to lead them
to the truth. Some people think they have to tear down
the scaffolding before they begin on the building. An
old minister once invited a young brother to preach for
him. The latter scolded the people, and when he got
home, asked the old minister how he had done. He said
he had an old cow, and when he wanted a good supply
of milk, he fed the cow; he did not scold her.</p>


<h4>A Long Time to Reap</h4>

<p>A man died in the Columbus penitentiary some years
ago who had spent over thirty years in his cell. He was
one of the millionaires of Ohio. Fifty years ago when
they were trying to get a trunk road from Chicago to
New York, they wanted to lay the line through his farm
near Cleveland. He did not want his farm divided by
the railroad, so the case went into court, where commissioners
were appointed to pay the damages and to allow
the road to be built.</p>

<p>One dark night, a train was thrown off the track, and
several were killed. This man was suspected, was tried
and found guilty, and was sent to the penitentiary for
life. The farm was soon cut up into city lots, and the
man became a millionaire, but he got no benefit from it.</p>

<p>It may not have taken him more than an hour to lay
the obstruction on the railroad, but he was over thirty
years reaping the result of that one act!</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>
<h4>"As a Little Child"</h4>

<p>A little child is the most dependent thing on earth.
All its resources are in its parents' love; all it can do is
to cry; and its necessities explain the meaning to the
mother's heart. If we interpret its language, it means:
"Mother, wash me; I cannot wash myself. Mother,
clothe me; I am naked, and cannot clothe myself.
Mother, feed me; I cannot feed myself. Mother, carry
me; I cannot walk." It is written, "A mother may
forget her sucking child; yet will not I forget thee."</p>

<p>This it is to receive the Kingdom of God as a little
child&mdash;to come to Jesus in our helplessness, and say:
"Lord Jesus, wash me!" "Clothe me!" "Feed me!"
"Carry me!" "Save me, Lord, or I perish."&mdash;Rainsford.</p>


<h4>Following the Lamb</h4>

<p>A friend who lost all his children told me about being
in an eastern country some time ago, and he saw a shepherd
going down to a stream, and he wanted to get his
flock across. He went into the water and called them by
name, but they came to the bank and bleated, and were
too afraid to follow. At last he went back, tightened
his girdle about his loins, took up two little lambs,
and put one inside his frock, and another inside his
bosom. Then he started into the water, and the old
sheep looked up to the shepherd instead of down into the
water. They wanted to see their little ones. So he got
them over the water, and led them into the green pastures
on the other side.</p>

<p>How many times the Good Shepherd has come down
here and taken a little lamb to the hill-tops of glory, and
then the father and mother begin to look up and follow.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>
<h4>Two Pictures</h4>

<p>A friend told me of a poor man who had sent his son
to school in the city. One day the father was hauling
some wood into the city, perhaps to pay his boy's bills.
The young man was walking down the street with two of
his school friends, all dressed in the very height of fashion.
His father saw him, and was so glad that he left
his wood, and went to the sidewalk to speak to him. But
the boy was ashamed of his father, who had on his old
working clothes, and spurned him, and said:</p>

<p>"I don't know you."</p>

<p>Will such a young man ever amount to anything?
Never!</p>

<p>There was a very promising young man in my Sunday-school
in Chicago. His father was a confirmed drunkard,
and his mother took in washing to educate her four
children. This was her eldest son, and I thought that
he was going to redeem the whole family. But one day
a thing happened that made him go down in my estimation.</p>

<p>The boy was in the high school, and was a very bright
scholar. One day he stood with his mother at the cottage
door&mdash;it was a poor house, but she could not pay
for their schooling and feed and clothe her children and
hire a very good house too out of her earnings. When
they were talking a young man from the high school
came up the street, and this boy walked away from his
mother. Next day the young man said:</p>

<p>"Who was that I saw you talking to yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that was my washerwoman."</p>

<p>I said: "Poor fellow! He will never amount to
anything."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>That was a good many years ago. I have kept my eye
on him. He has gone down, down, down, and now he
is just a miserable wreck. Of course, he would go
down! Ashamed of his mother that loved him and
toiled for him, and bore so much hardship for him! I
cannot tell you the contempt I had for that one act.</p>

<p>Let us look at&mdash;</p>


<h4>A Brighter Picture</h4>

<p>Some years ago I heard of a poor woman who sent
her boy to school and college. When he was to graduate,
he wrote his mother to come, but she sent back
word that she could not because her best skirt had
already been turned once. She was so shabby that she
was afraid he would be ashamed of her. He wrote back
that he didn't care how she was dressed, and urged so
strongly that she went. He met her at the station, and
took her to a nice place to stay. The day came for his
graduation, and he walked down the broad aisle with
that poor mother dressed very shabbily, and put her into
one of the best seats in the house. To her great surprise
he was the valedictorian of the class, and he carried
everything before him. He won a prize, and when
it was given to him, he stepped down before the whole
audience and kissed his mother, and said:</p>

<p>"Here, mother, here is the prize! It's yours. I
would not have won it if it had not been for you."</p>

<p>Thank God for such a man!</p>


<h4>The Folly of Covetousness</h4>

<p>The folly of covetousness is well shown in the following
extract:</p>

<p>"If you should see a man that had a large pond of
water, yet living in continual thirst, nor suffering himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
to drink half a draught for fear of lessening his pond; if
you should see him wasting his time and strength in
fetching more water to his pond, always thirsty, yet
always carrying a bucket of water in his hand, watching
early and late to catch the drops of rain, gaping after
every cloud, and running greedily into every mire and
mud in hopes of water, and always studying how to make
every ditch empty itself into the pond; if you should see
him grow gray in these anxious labors, and at last end
a thirsty life by falling into his own pond, would you not
say that such a one was not only the author of his own
disquiet, but was foolish enough to be reckoned among
madmen? But foolish and absurd as this character is, it
does not represent half the follies and absurd disquiets
of the covetous man."</p>

<p>I have read of a millionaire in France, who was a
miser. In order to make sure of his wealth, he dug a
cave in his wine cellar so large and deep that he could
go down into it with a ladder. The entrance had a door
with a spring lock. After a time, he was missing.
Search was made, but they could find no trace of him.
At last his house was sold, and the purchaser discovered
this door in the cellar. He opened it, went down, and
found the miser lying dead on the ground, in the midst
of his riches. The door must have shut accidentally
after him, and he perished miserably.</p>


<h4>What is Needed</h4>

<p>Nine-tenths, at least, of our church members never
think of speaking for Christ. If they see a man, perhaps
a near relative, going right down to ruin, going
rapidly, they never think of speaking to him about his
sinful course and of seeking to win him to Christ. Now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
certainly there must be something wrong. And yet
when you talk with them you find they have faith, and
you cannot say they are not children of God; but they
have not the power, the liberty, the love that real disciples
of Christ should have.</p>

<p>A great many think that we need new measures, new
churches, new organs, new choirs, and all these new
things. That is not what the Church of God needs
to-day. It is the old power that the apostles had. If
we have that in our churches, there will be new life.</p>

<p>I remember when in Chicago many were toiling in
the work, and it seemed as though the car of salvation
didn't move on, when a minister began to cry out from
the very depths of his heart:</p>

<p>"Oh, God, put new ministers in every pulpit."</p>

<p>Next Monday I heard two or three men stand up and
say, "We had a new minister last Sunday&mdash;the same old
minister, but he had got new power," and I firmly believe
that is what we want to-day all over America&mdash;new ministers
in the pulpit and new people in the pews. We
want people quickened by the Spirit of God.</p>


<h4>Neglecting Church</h4>

<p>A minister rebuked a farmer for not attending church,
and said:</p>

<p>"You know, John, you are never absent from market."</p>

<p>"Oh," was the reply, "we <i>must</i> go to market."</p>


<h4>Oratorical Preaching</h4>

<p>My friends, we have too many orators in the pulpit,
I am tired and sick of your "silver-tongued orators."
I used to mourn because I couldn't be an orator. I
thought, Oh, if I could only have the gift of speech like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
some men! I have heard men with a smooth flow of
language take the audience captive; but they came and
they went. Their voice was like the air&mdash;there wasn't
any <i>power</i> back of it; they trusted in their eloquence and
their fine speeches. That is what Paul was thinking of
when he wrote to the Corinthians: "My speech and my
preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom,
but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: that
your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but
in the power of God."</p>

<p>Take a witness in court and let him try his oratorical
powers in the witness-box, and see how quickly the
judge will rule him out. It is the man who tells the
plain, simple truth that has the most influence with the
jury.</p>

<p>Suppose that Moses had prepared a speech for Pharaoh,
and had got his hair all smoothly brushed, and had
stood before the looking-glass, or had gone to an elocutionist
to be taught how to make an oratorical speech
and how to make gestures. Suppose that he had buttoned
his coat, put one hand in his chest, had struck an
attitude, and begun:</p>

<p>"The God of our fathers, the God of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, has commanded me to come into the
presence of the noble King of Egypt."</p>

<p>I think they would have taken his head right off!
They had Egyptians who could be as eloquent as Moses.
It was not eloquence they wanted.</p>


<h4>To Which Class Do You Belong?</h4>

<p>Some one has said that there are three classes of people:
the "wills," the "won'ts," and the "can'ts"; the
first accomplish everything, the second oppose everything,
and the third fail in everything.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>
<h4>Sunday Work</h4>

<p>A Christian man was once urged by his employer to
work on Sunday.</p>

<p>"Does not your Bible say that if your ass falls into a
pit on the Sabbath, you may pull him out?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the other; "but if the ass had the
habit of falling into the same pit every Sabbath, I would
either fill up the pit or sell the ass."</p>


<h4>There Must Be Roots</h4>

<p>Suppose I hire two men to set out trees, and after a
day or two I go out to see how they are getting along.
I find that one man has set out a hundred trees, and the
other only ten. I say:</p>

<p>"Look here; what does this mean? That man has
set out a hundred trees, and you have set out only ten.
What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he has cut off all the roots, and, just stuck
the tops into the ground."</p>

<p>I go to the other man, and say: "What does this
mean? Why have you planted all of these trees without
roots?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe in roots; they are of no account.
My trees look just as well as his."</p>

<p>But when the sun blazes upon the trees, they all
wither and die.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people running around who haven't
got any roots. A good many live on negations. They
are always telling what they <i>don't</i> believe. I want a
man to tell me what he <i>does</i> believe, not what he does
not believe. And I like to meet a positive man. We
just want to know what men do believe. We don't want
trees that haven't any roots, for they will dry up when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the sun blazes on them. There are a good many persons
that are going on without any foundation; they
have no faith.</p>


<h4>The Path of Obedience</h4>

<p>Whatsoever He tells you to do, do. But be sure He
says it. Don't take your ideas. Go and live right at
home, go and treat your wife and children right, pay your
debts, and do some things of that kind.</p>

<p>A colored man said he had seen a sign; he said it
read, "G. P. C," and he understood it to mean, "Go
preach Christ."</p>

<p>Another man got up, and said. "No, that ain't it; it
is 'Go pick cotton.'"</p>

<p>If it is preach the gospel, go preach the gospel; and if
it is pick cotton, then pick cotton.</p>


<h4>Calling a Man a Liar</h4>

<p>You cannot offer a man a greater insult than to tell
him he is a liar. Unbelief is telling God He is a liar.</p>

<p>Suppose a man said, "Mr. Moody, I have no faith in
you whatever." Don't you think it would grieve me?
There is not anything that would wound a man much
more than to be told that you do not have any faith in
him.</p>

<p>A great many men say, "Oh, I have profound reverence
and respect for God."</p>

<p>Yes, profound respect, but not faith. Why, it is a
downright insult!</p>

<p>Suppose a man says, "Mr. Moody, I have profound
respect for you, profound admiration for you, but I do
not believe a word you say."</p>

<p>I wouldn't give much for his respect or admiration;
I wouldn't give much for his friendship. God wants us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
to put our faith in Him. How it would wound a mother's
feelings to hear her children say, "I do love mamma so
much, but I don't believe what she says." How it would
grieve that mother. And that is about the way a great
many of God's professed children talk. Some men
seem to think it is a great misfortune that they do not
have faith. Bear in mind it is not a misfortune, but it
is the damning sin of the world.</p>


<h4>Bending His Will</h4>

<p>A mother told me up in Minnesota that she had a little
child who took a book and threw it out of the window.
She told him to go and pick it up. The little
boy said, "I won't."</p>

<p>She said, "What?"</p>

<p>He said again, "I won't."</p>

<p>She said: "You must. Go and pick up that book."</p>

<p>He said he couldn't do it. She took him out, and
she held him right to it. Dinner-time came, and he
hadn't picked up the book. She took him to dinner,
and after it was over she took him out again. They sat
there until tea-time. When tea-time came she took him
in and gave him his supper, and then took him out and
kept him there until bed-time. The next morning she
went out again and kept him there until dinner-time. He
found he was in for a life job, and he picked the book up.</p>

<p>She said she never had any trouble with the child
afterward. Mothers, if you don't make your boy obey
when he is young, he will break your heart.</p>


<h4>How To Find the Thirsty</h4>

<p>When preaching in Chicago, Dr. Monro Gibson once
asked in the inquiry meeting, "Now, how can we find
out who is thirsty? I was just thinking how we could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
find out. If a boy should come down the aisle, bringing
a good pail full of clear water and a dipper, we would
soon find out who was thirsty. The thirsty men and
women would reach out for water; but if he should walk
down the aisle with an empty bucket, we wouldn't find
out. People would look in and see that there was no
water, and say nothing. So," said he, "I think that is
the reason we are not more blessed in our ministry; we
are carrying around empty buckets, and the people see
that we have not anything in them, and they don't come
forward."</p>


<h4>Making Parables</h4>

<p>Stewart Robertson met Marshall, the great politician,
and Marshall said:</p>

<p>"Why don't you preach in parables like your Master?"</p>

<p>Robertson said: "I would if I knew enough. I wish
you would make me a few."</p>

<p>He never could get to see him from that day until one
day he met him on a corner, and he said:</p>

<p>"Marshall, where are those parables?"</p>

<p>"I knew you would be after me, but I give it up.
I tried, but I couldn't make them. I didn't know it
was so hard."</p>

<p>People say, "Oh, any one can make up a sermon."
But if you think so, just try it!</p>


<h4>A Father's Mistake</h4>

<p>The story is told that a man once said he would not
talk to his son about religion; the boy should make his
own choice when he grew up, unprejudiced by him.</p>

<p>The boy broke his arm, and when the doctor was
setting it, he cursed and swore the whole time. The
father was quite grieved and shocked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah," said the doctor, "you were afraid to prejudice
the boy in the right way, but the devil had no such
prejudice. He has led your son the other way."</p>

<p>The idea that a father is to let his children run
wild! Nature alone never brings forth anything but
weeds.</p>


<h4>A Rum-Seller's Son Blows His Brains Out</h4>

<p>Look at that rum-seller. When we talk to him he
laughs at us. He tells you there is no hell, no future&mdash;there
is no retribution. I've got one man in my mind
now who ruined nearly all the sons in his neighborhood.
Mothers and fathers went to him and begged him not to
sell their children liquor. He told them it was his business
to sell liquor, and he was going to sell liquor to
every one who came. The saloon was a blot upon the
place as dark as hell.</p>

<p>But the man had a father's heart. He had a son.
He didn't worship God, but he worshiped that boy. He
didn't remember that whatsoever a man soweth so shall
he reap. My friends, they generally reap what they sow.
It may not come immediately, but the retribution will
surely come. If you ruin other men's sons, some other
man will ruin yours. Bear in mind God is a God of
equity; God is a God of justice. He is not going to
allow you to ruin others and escape yourself. If we go
against His laws, we suffer.</p>

<p>Time rolled on, and that young man became a slave
to drink, and his life became such a burden to him that
he put a revolver to his head and blew his brains out.
The father lived a few years, but his life was as bitter as
gall, and then went down to his grave in sorrow. Ah,
my friends, it is hard to kick against the pricks.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>
<h4>Mrs. Moody Teaching Her Child</h4>

<p>There was a time when our little boy did not like to
go to church, and would get up in the morning and say
to his mother:</p>

<p>"What day is to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Tuesday."</p>

<p>"Next day?"</p>

<p>"Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Next day?"</p>

<p>"Thursday"; and so on, till he came to the answer,
"Sunday."</p>

<p>"Dear me," he said.</p>

<p>I said to the mother, "We cannot have our boy grow
up to hate Sunday in this way; that will never do. That
is the way I used to feel when I was a boy. I used to
look upon Sunday with a certain amount of dread. Very
few kind words were associated with the day. I don't
know that the minister even noticed me, unless it was
when I was asleep in the gallery, and he had some one
wake me up. This kind of thing won't do. We must
make the Sunday the most attractive day of the week;
not a day to be dreaded, but a day of pleasure."</p>

<p>Well, the mother took the work up with this boy.
Bless those mothers in their work with the children!
Sometimes I feel as if I would rather be the mother of
John Wesley or Martin Luther or John Knox than have
all the glories in the world. Those mothers who are
faithful with the children God has given them will not
go unrewarded.</p>

<p>My wife went to work, and took Bible stories and put
those blessed truths in a light that the boy could comprehend,
and soon his feeling for the Sabbath was the
other way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"What day's to-morrow?" he would ask.</p>

<p>"Sunday."</p>

<p>"I am glad."</p>

<p>If we make Bible truths interesting, and break them
up in some shape so that these children can get at them,
then they will begin to enjoy them.</p>


<h4>Missed At Last!</h4>

<p>In one of the tenement houses in New York City a
doctor was sent for. He came, and found a young man
very sick. When he got to the bedside the young man
said:</p>

<p>"Doctor, I don't want you to deceive me; I want to
know the worst. Is this illness to prove serious?"</p>

<p>After the doctor had made an examination, he said,
"I am sorry to tell you you cannot live out the
night."</p>

<p>The young man looked up and said, "Well, then, I
have missed it at last!"</p>

<p>"Missed what?"</p>

<p>"I have missed eternal life. I always intended to
become a Christian some day, but I thought I had plenty
of time, and put it off."</p>

<p>The doctor, who was himself a Christian man, said:
"It is not too late. Call on God for mercy."</p>

<p>"No; I have always had a great contempt for a man
who repents when he is dying; he is a miserable coward.
If I were not sick, I would not have a thought about my
soul, and I am not going to insult God now."</p>

<p>The doctor spent the day with him, read to him out
of the Bible, and tried to get him to lay hold of the
promises. The young man said he would not call on
God, and in that state of mind he passed away. Just as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
he was dying the doctor saw his lips moving. He reached
down, and all he could hear was the faint whisper:</p>

<p>"<i>I have missed it at last!</i>"</p>

<p>Dear friend, make sure that you do not miss eternal
life at last.</p>


<h4>Choose Now</h4>

<p>A teacher had been relating to his class the parable
of the rich man and Lazarus, and he asked:</p>

<p>"Now, which would you rather be, boys, the rich man
or Lazarus?"</p>

<p>One boy answered, "I would rather be the rich man
while I live, and Lazarus when I die."</p>

<p>That cannot be.</p>


<h4>The Mansion Made Ready</h4>

<p>Once when I was traveling to a city there was a lady
in the car with me. After I had reached the hotel where
I was to stay, and had got comfortable quarters, she
came, and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, I cannot get a room in this hotel; they are
quite full! How ever did you manage to get a room?"</p>

<p>"Easily enough," I replied; "I just telegraphed on
before that I was coming, to have a room ready for me."</p>

<p>And it is somewhat similar in regard to gaining
admission to heaven. Your names must be sent on
beforehand, and entered in its book, else you won't get
in; but get your names inscribed on its pages, and then
you won't be disappointed. God will have a mansion
ready for you when you ascend to your heavenly home.
When you come to its gates, the guardian angels will
refer to the book of life to see if your name is there. If
so, pass in; but if not, admittance will be inexorably
refused.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<h4>The Promise For All</h4>

<p>Every one of God's proclamations is connected with
that word "whosoever"&mdash;"whosoever believeth," "whosoever
will." I think it was Richard Baxter said he
thanked God for that "whosoever." He would a good
deal rather have that word "whosoever" than Richard
Baxter; for if it was Richard Baxter, he should have
thought it was some other Richard Baxter who had lived
and died before him; but "whosoever" he knew included
him.</p>

<p>I heard of a woman once that thought there was no
promise in the Bible for her; she thought the promises
were for some one else, not for her. There are a good
many of these people in the world. They think it is too
good to be true that they can be saved for nothing.
This woman one day got a letter, and when she opened it
she found it was not for her at all; it was meant for
another woman that had the same name; and she had
her eyes opened to the fact that if she should find some
promise in the Bible directed to her name, she would not
know whether it meant her or some one else that bore
her name. But you know the word "whosoever" includes
every one in the wide world.</p>


<h4>Reaping As They Sowed</h4>

<p>Although God forgave the sins of Jacob and David,
and the other Old Testament saints, yet there were certain
consequences of their sins which those saints had
to suffer after they were forgiven.</p>

<p>If a man gets drunk and goes out and breaks his leg,
so that it must be amputated, God will forgive him if he
asks it, but he will have to hop around on one leg all his
life. A man may sow thistle-seed with grain-seed in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
moment of pique against his master, and the master may
forgive him, but the man will have to reap the thistles
with the grain.</p>


<h4>Small Beginnings</h4>

<p>An obscure man preached one Sunday to a few persons
in a Methodist chapel in the South of England. A
boy of fifteen years of age was in the audience, driven
into the chapel by a snowstorm. The man took as his
text the words, "Look unto me and be ye saved," and
as he stumbled along as best he could, the light of
heaven flashed into that boy's heart. He went out of
the chapel saved, and soon became known as C. H.
Spurgeon, the boy-preacher.</p>

<p>The parsonage at Epworth, England, caught fire one
night, and all the inmates were rescued except one son.
The boy came to a window, and was brought safely to
the ground by two farm-hands, one standing on the
shoulder of the other. The boy was John Wesley. If
you would realize the responsibility of that incident, if
you would measure the consequences of that rescue, ask
the millions of Methodists who look back to John Wesley
as the founder of their denomination.</p>


<h4>Saying and Doing</h4>

<p>A man was once conversing with a Brahmin priest,
and he asked:</p>

<p>"Could <i>you</i> say, 'I am the Resurrection and the Life?'"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the priest, "I could say that."</p>

<p>"<i>But could you make any one believe it?</i>"</p>

<p>Christ proved His superiority right there. His character
and His actions were back of His words. He
exhibited His divine power to silence His enemies.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<h4>Climb Higher</h4>

<p>I remember being in a meeting after the Civil War
had been going on for about six months. The army of
the North had been defeated at Bull Run; in fact, we
had nothing but defeat, and it looked as though the
Republic was going to pieces; so we were much cast
down and discouraged. At this meeting every speaker
for a while seemed as if he had hung his harp upon the
willow; it was one of the gloomiest meetings I ever
attended. Finally an old man with beautiful white hair
got up to speak, and his face literally shone.</p>

<p>"Young men," he said, "you do not talk like sons of
the King. Though it is dark just here, remember it is
light somewhere else." Then he went on to say that if
it were dark all over the world, it was light up around
the Throne.</p>

<p>He told us he had come from the East, where a friend
had described to him how he had been up a mountain to
spend the night and see the sun rise. As the party were
climbing up the mountain, and before they had reached
the summit, a storm came on. This friend said to the
guide:</p>

<p>"I will give this up; take me back."</p>

<p>The guide smiled, and replied: "I think we shall get
above the storm soon."</p>

<p>On they went; and it was not long before they got up
to where it was as calm as any summer evening. Down
in the valley a terrible storm raged; they could hear the
thunder rolling, and see the lightning's flash; but all was
serene on the mountain top.</p>

<p>"And so, my young friends," continued the old man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
"though all is dark around you, come a little higher,
and the darkness will flee away."</p>

<p>Often when I have been inclined to get discouraged, I
have thought of what he said. If you are down in the
valley amidst the thick fog and the darkness, get a little
higher; get nearer to Christ, and know more of Him.</p>


<h4>The Greatest Miracle</h4>

<p>Jesus said, "The works that I do shall ye do also, and
greater works than these shall ye do because I go to the
Father."</p>

<p>I used to stumble over that. I didn't understand it.
I thought what greater work could any man do than
Christ had done? How could any one raise a dead man
who had been laid away in the sepulchre for days, and
who had already begun to turn back to dust; how with a
word could he call him forth?</p>

<p>But the longer I live the more I am convinced it is a
greater thing to influence a man's will; a man whose will
is set against God; to have that will broken and brought
into subjection to God's will&mdash;or, in other words, it is a
greater thing to have power over a living, sinning, God-hating
man, than to quicken the dead. He who could
create a world could speak a dead soul into life; but I
think the greatest miracle this world has ever seen was
the miracle at Pentecost. Here were men who surrounded
the apostles, full of prejudice, full of malice, full of bitterness,
their hands, as it were, dripping with the blood
of the Son of God, and yet an unlettered man, a man
whom they detested, a man whom they hated, stands up
and preaches the Gospel, and three thousand of them are
immediately convicted and converted, and become disciples
of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>
<h4>Different Kinds of Murder</h4>

<p>One young man at college, an only son, whose mother
wrote to him remonstrating against his gambling and
drinking habits, took the letters out of the post-office,
and when he found that they were from her, he tore
them up without reading them. She said:</p>

<p>"I thought I would die when I found I had lost my
hold on that son."</p>

<p>If a boy kills his mother by his conduct, you can't call
it anything else than <i>murder</i>, and he is as truly guilty of
breaking the sixth commandment as if he drove a dagger
to her heart.</p>


<h4>"It Is Not For You!"</h4>

<p>Commenting on the text: "It is not for you to know
the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in
His own power," Spurgeon said:</p>

<p>"If I were introduced into a room where a large number
of parcels were stored up, and I was told that there
was something good for me, I should begin to look for
that which had my name upon it, and when I came upon
a parcel and I saw in pretty big letters, '<i>It is not for you</i>,'
I should leave it alone. Here, then, is a casket of knowledge
marked, '<i>It is not for you</i> to know the times or the
seasons, which the Father hath put in His own power.'
Cease to meddle with matters which are concealed, and
be satisfied to know the things which are clearly revealed."</p>


<h4>Stolen Goods a Burden</h4>

<p>I heard of a boy who stole a cannon-ball from a navy-yard.
He watched his opportunity, sneaked into the
yard, and secured it. But when he had it, he hardly
knew what to do with it. It was heavy, and too large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
to conceal in his pocket, so he had to put it under his
hat. When he got home with it, he dared not show it to
his parents, because it would have led at once to his
detection.</p>

<p>He said in after years it was the last thing he ever
stole.</p>

<p>The story is told that a royal diamond valued at
$600,000 was stolen from a window of a jeweler, to
whom it had been given to set. A few months afterward
a miserable man died a miserable death in a poor lodging-house.
In his pocket was found the diamond, and a
letter telling how he had not dared to sell it, lest it
should lead to his discovery and imprisonment. It
never brought him anything but anxiety and pain.</p>


<h4>Unlocked By Prayer</h4>

<p>God's best gifts, like valuable jewels, are kept under
lock and key, and those who want them must, with fervent
faith, importunately ask for them; for God is the
rewarder of them that <i>diligently</i> seek Him.</p>


<h4>The Faithful Promiser</h4>

<p>God is always true to what He promises to do. He
made promises to Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, and
the others, and did He not fulfill them? He will fulfill
every word of what He has promised; yet how few take
Him at His word!</p>

<p>When I was a young man I was clerk in the establishment
of a man in Chicago, whom I observed frequently
occupied sorting and marking bills. He explained to me
what he had been doing; on some notes he had marked
B, on some D, and on others G; those marked B, he
told me, were bad, those marked D meant they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
doubtful, and those with G on them mean they were
<i>good</i>; and, said he, you must treat all of them accordingly.
And thus people indorse God's promises, by
marking some as bad and others as doubtful; whereas
we ought to take all of them as <i>good</i>, for He has never
once broken His word, and all that He says He will do,
will be done in the fullness of time.</p>


<h4>Throw Out the Ballast</h4>

<p>When men go up in a balloon, they carry with them
what they call ballast&mdash;that is, small bags of sand, and
when they want to rise higher they just throw out some
of the sand. So we, if we want to rise nearer heaven,
must just throw out some of the sand, and cast aside
every weight. We won't rise higher till we do so.</p>


<h4>A Mother's Love</h4>

<p>The closest tie on earth is a mother's love for her
child. There are a good many things that will separate
a man from his wife, but there isn't a thing in the wide,
wide world that will separate a true mother from her own
child. I will admit that there are unnatural mothers,
that there are mothers that have gone out of their heads,
mothers that are so steeped in sin and iniquity that they
will turn against their own children, but a true mother
will never, never turn against her own child. I have
talked with mothers when my blood boiled with indignation
against the sons for their treatment of their mothers,
and I have said:</p>

<p>"Why don't you cast him off?"</p>

<p>They have said: "Why, Mr. Moody, I love him still.
He is my son."</p>

<p>I was once preaching for Dr. G. in St. Louis, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
when I got through he said that he wanted to tell me a
story. There was a boy who was very bad. He had a
very bad father, who seemed to take delight in teaching
his son everything that was bad. The father died, and
the boy went on from bad to worse until he was arrested
for murder.</p>

<p>When he was on trial, it came out that he had murdered
five other people, and from one end of the city to
the other there was a universal cry going up against him.
During his trial they had to guard the court-house, the
indignation was so intense.</p>

<p>The white-haired mother got just as near her son as
she could, and every witness that went into the court
and said anything against him seemed to hurt her more
than her son. When the jury brought in a verdict of
guilty a great shout went up, but the old mother nearly
fainted away; and when the judge pronounced the sentence
of death they thought she would faint away.</p>

<p>After it was over she threw her arms around him and
kissed him, and there in the court they had to tear him
from her embrace. She then went the length and
breadth of the city trying to get men to sign a petition
for his pardon. And when he was hanged, she begged
the governor to let her have the body of her son, that
she might bury it. They say that death has torn down
everything in this world, everything but a mother's love.
That is stronger than death itself. The governor refused
to let her have the body, but she cherished the memory
of that boy as long as she lived.</p>

<p>A few months later she followed her boy, and when
she was dying she sent word to the governor, and begged
that her body might be laid close to her son. That is a
mother's love! She wasn't ashamed to have her grave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
pointed out for all time as the grave of the mother of the
most noted criminal the State of Vermont ever had.</p>

<p>The prophet takes hold of that very idea. He says:
"Can a mother forget her child?" But a mother's love
is not to be compared to the love of God.</p>


<h4>Restitution</h4>

<p>I was preaching in British Columbia some years ago
and a young man came to me, and wanted to become a
Christian. He had been smuggling opium into the
States.</p>

<p>"Well, my friend," I said, "I don't think there is any
chance for you to become a Christian until you make
restitution." He said, "If I attempt to do that, I will
fall into the clutches of the law, and I will go to the
penitentiary." "Well," I replied, "you had better do
that than go to the judgment-seat of God with that sin
upon your soul, and have eternal punishment. The
Lord will be very merciful if you set your face to do
right."</p>

<p>He went away sorrowful, but came back the next day,
and said: "I have a young wife and child, and all the
furniture in my house I have bought with money I have
got in this dishonest way. If I become a Christian, that
furniture will have to go, and my wife will know it."</p>

<p>"Better let your wife know it, and better let your
home and furniture go."</p>

<p>"Would you come up and see my wife?" he asked; "I
don't know what she will say."</p>

<p>I went up to see her, and when I told her, the tears
trickled down her cheeks, and she said: "Mr. Moody,
I will gladly give everything if my husband can become
a true Christian."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>She took out her pocketbook, and handed over her
last penny. He had a piece of land in the United
States, which he deeded over to the government. I do
not know, in all my backward track, of any living man
who has had a better testimony for Jesus Christ than
that man. He had been dishonest, but when the truth
came to him that he must make it right before God
would help him, he made it right.</p>

<p>No amount of weeping over sin, and saying that you
feel sorry, is going to help it unless you are willing to
confess and make restitution.</p>


<h4>Willie and the Bears</h4>

<p>I said to my little family, one morning, a few weeks
before the Chicago fire, "I am coming home this afternoon
to give you a ride."</p>

<p>My little boy clapped his hands. "Oh, papa, will
you take me to see the bears in Lincoln Park?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>I had not been gone long when my little boy said,
"Mamma, I wish you would get me ready."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "it will be a long time before papa
comes."</p>

<p>"But I want to get ready, mamma."</p>

<p>At last he was ready to have the ride, face washed,
and clothes all nice and clean.</p>

<p>"Now, you must take good care, and not get yourself
dirty again," said mamma.</p>

<p>Of course, he was going to take care; he wasn't going
to get dirty! So off he ran to watch for me. However,
it was a long time yet until the afternoon, and after a
little he began to play. When I got home, I found him
outside, with his face all covered with dirt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't take you to the park that way, Willie."</p>

<p>"Why papa? you said you would take me."</p>

<p>"Ah, but I can't; you're all over mud. I couldn't
be seen with such a dirty little boy."</p>

<p>"Why, I'se clean, papa; mamma washed me."</p>

<p>"Well, you've got dirty again."</p>

<p>But he began to cry, and I could not convince him
that he was dirty.</p>

<p>"I'se clean; mamma washed me!" he cried.</p>

<p>Do you think I argued with him? No. I just took
him up in my arms, and carried him into the house, and
showed him his face in the looking-glass. He had not a
word to say. He would not take my word for it; but
one look at the glass was enough; he saw it for himself.
He didn't say he wasn't dirty after that!</p>

<p>Now, the looking-glass showed him that his face was
dirty&mdash;<i>but I did not take the looking-glass to wash it</i>; of
course not. Yet that is just what thousands of people
do. The Law is the looking-glass to see ourselves in,
to show us how vile and worthless we are in the sight of
God; but they take the Law and try to <i>wash</i> themselves
with it, instead of being washed in the blood of the
Lamb.</p>


<h4>Christ For All</h4>

<p>An old Welshwoman said Christ was Welsh, and an
Englishman said:</p>

<p>"No, He was a Jew."</p>

<p>She declared that she knew He was Welsh, because
He spoke so that she could understand Him.</p>


<h4>Starting Right</h4>

<p>Many a man is lost because he does not start right.
He makes a bad start. A young man comes from his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
country home, and enters upon city life. Temptation
arises, and he becomes false to his principles. He meets
with some scoffing, sneering man, who jeers at him
because he goes to a church service; or because he is
seen reading his Bible; or because he is known to pray
to God. And the young man proves to be weak-kneed;
he cannot stand the scoffs and the sneers and the jeers
of his companions; and so he becomes untrue to his
principles, and gives them up.</p>

<p>I want to say here to young men, that when a young
man makes a wrong start, in ninety-nine cases out of a
hundred it is ruin to him. The first game of chance;
the first betting transaction; the first false entry in the
books; the first quarter-dollar taken from the cash-box
or the till; the first night spent in evil company&mdash;either
of these may prove the turning-point; either of these
may represent a wrong start.</p>


<h4>Napoleon and the Conscript</h4>

<p>There is a well-known story told of Napoleon the
First's time. In one of the conscriptions, during one of
his many wars, a man was balloted as a conscript who
did not want to go, but he had a friend who offered to
go in his place. His friend joined the regiment in his
name, and was sent off to the war. By and by a battle
came on, in which he was killed, and they buried him on
the battle-field. Some time after, the Emperor wanted
more men, and by some mistake the first man was
balloted a second time. They went to take him, but he
remonstrated.</p>

<p>"You cannot take me."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I am dead," was the reply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are not dead; you are alive and well."</p>

<p>"But I <i>am</i> dead," he said.</p>

<p>"Why, man, you must be mad. Where did you die?"</p>

<p>"At such a battle, and you left me buried on such a
battle-field."</p>

<p>"You talk like a madman," they cried; but the man
stuck to his point that he had been dead and buried some
months.</p>

<p>"Look up your books," he said, "and see if it is not
so."</p>

<p>They looked, and found that he was right. They
found the man's name entered as drafted, sent to the
war, and marked off as killed.</p>

<p>"Look here," they said, "you didn't die; you must
have got some one to go for you; it must have been
your <i>substitute</i>."</p>

<p>"I know that," he said; "he died in my stead. You
cannot touch me; I died in that man, and I go free.
The law has no claim against me."</p>

<p>They would not recognize the doctrine of substitution,
and the case was carried to the Emperor. He said that
the man was right, that he was dead and buried in the
eyes of the law, and that France had no claim against
him.</p>

<p>This story may or may not be true, but one thing I
know is true: Jesus Christ suffered death for the sinner,
and those who accept Him are free from the Law.</p>


<h4>Green Fields or Desert?</h4>

<p>When I was out in California, the first time I went
down from the Sierra Nevada Mountains and dropped
into the Valley of the Sacramento, I was surprised to
find on one farm that everything about it was green&mdash;all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the trees and flowers, everything was blooming, and
everything was green and beautiful, and just across the
hedge everything was dried up, and there was not a
green thing there. I could not understand it. I made
inquiries, and I found that the man that had everything
green, irrigated; he just poured the water right on, and
kept everything green, while the fields that were next to
his were as dry as Gideon's fleece without a drop of dew.</p>

<p>So it is with a great many in the church to-day. They
are like these farms in California&mdash;a dreary desert, everything
parched and desolate, and apparently no life in
them. They can sit next to a man who is full of the
Spirit of God, who is like a green bay tree, and who is
bringing forth fruit, and yet they will not seek a similar
blessing.</p>

<p>Well, why this difference? Because God has poured
water on him that was thirsty; that is the difference.
One has been seeking this anointing, and he has received
it; and when we want this above everything else God will
surely give it to us.</p>


<h4>Religion In the Home</h4>

<p>What we want is family piety, righteousness in our
homes. A young minister came to me, and said he
couldn't get along with his wife, and what should he do?
I told him to get out of the ministry. A man has no
right to be in the pulpit unless he can get along with his
family.</p>


<h4>A Universal Failing</h4>

<p>It is a false idea that all pride is confined to the upper
classes. You will find it in the lanes and alleys. You
will find little dirty, barefooted children who will get a
string of shavings, put it round their necks, and strut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
down the street as if they were wearing golden beads.
Pride is born and grows in the human heart. You do
not plant it there; it grows there of itself. There is as
much pride among the poor as among the rich; and that
is one reason why more of them do not come to the Lord
Jesus Christ: they do not like to be laughed at, scoffed
at, sneered at, and ridiculed. It costs them too much.</p>


<h4>Words and Actions</h4>

<p>A man may preach with the eloquence of an angel,
but if he doesn't live what he preaches, and act out in his
home and his business what he professes, his testimony
goes for naught, and the people say it is all hypocrisy
after all; it is all a sham. Words are very empty, if
there is nothing back of them. Your testimony is poor
and worthless, if there is not a record back of that testimony
consistent with what you profess. What we need
is to pray to God to lift us up out of this low, cold, formal
state that we live in, that we may dwell in the atmosphere
of God continually, and that the Lord may lift
upon us the light of His countenance, and that we may
shine in this world, reflecting His grace and glory.</p>


<h4>The One-Eyed Doe</h4>

<p>There is an old fable that a doe that had but one eye
used to graze near the sea; and in order to be safe, she
kept her blind eye toward the water, from which side she
expected no danger, while with the good eye she watched
the country. Some men, noticing this, took a boat and
came upon her from the sea and shot her. With her
dying breath, she said:</p>

<p>"Oh! hard fate! that I should receive my death
wound from that side whence I expected no harm, and
be safe in the part where I looked for most danger."</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>
<h4>Lost Opportunities</h4>

<p>If a farmer neglects to plant in the springtime, he
can never recover the lost opportunity; no more can
you, if you neglect yours. Youth is a seed-time, and if
it is allowed to pass without good seed being sown,
weeds will spring up and choke the soil. It will take
bitter toil to uproot them.</p>

<p>An old divine said that when a good farmer sees a
weed in his field he has it pulled up. If it is taken early
enough, the blank is soon filled in, and the crop waves
over the whole field. But if allowed to run too late, the
bald patch remains. It would have been better if the
weed had never been allowed to get root.</p>


<h4>Steer Clear</h4>

<p>A steamboat was stranded in the Mississippi River,
and the captain could not get her off. Eventually a
hard-looking fellow came on board, and said:</p>

<p>"Captain, I understand you want a pilot to take you
out of this difficulty?"</p>

<p>The captain said, "Are you a pilot?"</p>

<p>"Well, they call me one."</p>

<p>"Do you know where the snags and sand-bars are?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, how do you expect to take me out of here if
you don't know where the snags and sand-bars are?"</p>

<p>"I know where they ain't!" was the reply.</p>

<p>Beware of temptations. "Lead us not into temptation,"
our Lord taught us to pray; and again He said,
"Watch and pray, lest ye enter into temptation." We
are weak and sinful by nature, and it is a good deal better
for us to pray for deliverance rather than to run into
temptation and then pray for strength to resist.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<h4>Looking for Revivals</h4>

<p>Men are anxious for a revival in business. There is a
great revival in politics just now. In all departments
of life you find that men are very anxious for a revival
in the things that concern them most.</p>

<p>If this is legitimate&mdash;and it is perfectly right in its
place&mdash;should not every child of God be praying for and
desiring a revival of godliness in the world at the present
time? Do we not need a revival of downright honesty,
of truthfulness, of uprightness, and of temperance? Are
there not many who have become alienated from the
Church of God and from the house of the Lord, who are
forming an attachment to the saloon? Are not our sons
being drawn away by hundreds and thousands, so that
while you often find the churches empty, the liquor
shops are crowded every Sabbath afternoon and evening?
I am sure the saloon-keepers are glad if they can have
a revival in their business; they do not object to sell
more whisky and beer. Then surely every true Christian
ought to desire that men who are in danger of perishing
eternally should be saved and rescued.</p>


<h4>Opportunity</h4>

<p>A sculptor once showed a visitor his studio. It was
full of statues of gods. One was very curious. The
face was concealed by being covered with hair, and there
were wings on each foot.</p>

<p>"What is his name?" said the visitor.</p>

<p>"Opportunity," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Why is his face hidden?"</p>

<p>"Because men seldom know him when he comes to
them."</p>

<p>"Why has he wings on his feet?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because he is soon gone, and once gone can never
be overtaken."</p>

<p>It becomes us, then, to make the most of the opportunities
God has given us.</p>


<h4>The Usual Way</h4>

<p>I used at one time to read so many chapters of the
Bible a day, and if I did not get through my usual
quantity, I thought I was getting cold and backsliding.
But, mind you, if a man had asked me two hours afterward
what I had read, I could not tell him; I had forgotten
it nearly all.</p>

<p>When I was a boy I used, among other things, to hoe
corn on a farm; and I used to hoe it so badly, in order
to get over so much ground, that at night I had to put
down a stick in the ground, so as to know next morning
where I had left off.</p>

<p>That was somewhat in the same fashion as running
through so many chapters every day. A man will say,
"Wife, did I read that chapter?"</p>

<p>"Well," says she, "I don't remember."</p>

<p>And neither of them can recollect. And perhaps he
reads the same chapter over and over again; and they
call that "studying the Bible." I do not think there is
a book in the world we neglect so much as the Bible.</p>


<h4>Getting On Splendidly</h4>

<p>One man said to another, some time ago: "How are
you getting on at your church?"</p>

<p>"Oh, splendid."</p>

<p>"Many conversions?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well, on that side we are not getting on so
well. But," he said, "we have rented all our pews and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
are able to pay all our running expenses. We are getting
on splendidly."</p>

<p>That is what the godless call "getting on splendidly."
They rent the pews, pay the minister, and meet all the
running expenses.</p>

<p>A man was being shown through one of the cathedrals
of Europe; he had come in from the country. One of
the men belonging to the cathedral was showing him
around, when he inquired:</p>

<p>"Do you have may conversions here?"</p>

<p>"Many what?"</p>

<p>"Many conversions here?"</p>

<p>"Ah, man, this is not a Wesleyan chapel."</p>

<p>The idea of there being conversions there! And you
can go into a good many churches in this country and
ask if they have many conversions there, and they would
not know what it meant, they are so far away from the
Lord; they are not looking for conversions, and don't
expect them.</p>


<h4>A Hundred Years Hence</h4>

<p>Once, as I was walking down the street, I heard
some people laughing and talking aloud. One of them
said:</p>

<p>"Well, there will be no difference; it will be all the
same a hundred years hence."</p>

<p>The thought flashed across my mind, "Will there be
no difference? Where will you be a hundred years
hence?"</p>

<p>Young man, just ask yourself the question, "Where
shall I be?" Some of you who are getting on in years
may be in eternity ten years hence. Where will you be,
on the left or the right hand of God? I cannot tell your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
feelings, but I can my own. I ask you, "Where will
you spend eternity? Where will you be a hundred years
hence?"</p>


<h4>A Free Gift</h4>

<p>Remember, salvation is a free gift, and it is a free
gift <i>for us</i>. Can you buy it? It is a free gift, presented
to "whosoever" will accept it.</p>

<p>Suppose I were to say, I will give this Bible to "whosoever"
will take it; what have you got to do? Why,
nothing but take it. But a man comes forward, and says:</p>

<p>"I'd like that Bible very much."</p>

<p>"Well, didn't I say 'whosoever' will can have it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I'd like to have you mention my name."</p>

<p>"Well, here it is."</p>

<p>Still he keeps eyeing the Bible, and saying, "I'd like
to have that Bible; but I'd like to give you something for
it. I don't like to take it for nothing."</p>

<p>"But I am not here to sell Bibles; take it, if you
want it."</p>

<p>"Well, I want it; but I'd like to give you something
for it. Let me give you a cent for it; though, to be
sure, it's worth about five dollars."</p>

<p>Suppose I accept the cent; the man takes up the Bible
and marches away home with it.</p>

<p>His wife asks, "Where did you get that Bible?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I bought it."</p>

<p>Mark the point; when he gave the penny, it ceased to
be a gift. So with salvation. If you were to pay ever
so little, it would not be a gift.</p>


<h4>What Seed Are You Sowing?</h4>

<p>Suppose I meet a man who is sowing seed, and say,
"Hello, stranger, what are you sowing?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Seed."</p>

<p>"What kind of seed?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Don't you know whether it is good or bad?"</p>

<p>"No; I can't tell. But it is seed&mdash;that is all I want
to know, and I am sowing it."</p>

<p>You would say that he was a first-class lunatic,
wouldn't you? But he wouldn't be half so mad as the
man who goes on sowing for time and eternity, and never
asks himself what he is sowing or what the harvest will be.</p>

<p>Father, what seed are you sowing in your family?
Are you setting your children a good or a bad example?
Do you spend your time at the saloon or the club, until
you have become almost a stranger to them? or are you
training them for God and righteousness?</p>


<h4>Bound Hand and Foot</h4>

<p>When I was speaking to five thousand children in
Glasgow some years ago, I took a spool of thread and
said to one of the largest boys:</p>

<p>"Do you believe I can bind you with that thread?"</p>

<p>He laughed at the idea. I wound the thread around
him a few times, and he broke it with a single jerk.
Then I wound the thread around and around, and by
and by I said:</p>

<p>"Now get free if you can."</p>

<p>He couldn't move head or foot. If you are slave to
some vile habit, you must either slay that habit, or it will
slay you.</p>


<h4>Unity</h4>

<p>There is one thing I have noticed as I have traveled in
different countries; I never yet have known the Spirit of
God to work where the Lord's people were divided.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Unity is one thing that we must have if we are to have
the Holy Spirit of God to work in our midst.</p>

<p>If a church is divided, the members should immediately
seek unity. Let the believers come together and
get the difficulty out of the way. If the minister of a
church cannot unite the people, if those that were dissatisfied
will not fall in, it would be better for that minister
to retire. I think there are a good many ministers in
this country who are losing their time; they have lost,
some of them, months and years; they have not seen any
fruit, and they will not see any fruit, because they have a
divided church. Such a church cannot grow in divine
things. The Spirit of God doesn't work where there is
division, and what we want to-day is the spirit of unity
amongst God's children, so that the Lord may work.</p>


<h4>Get Inside!</h4>

<p>You have looked at the windows of a grand church
erected at the cost of many thousands of dollars. From
the outside they did not seem very beautiful; but get
inside, when the rays of the sun are striking upon the
stained glass, and you begin to understand what others
have told you of their magnificence. So it is when you
have come into personal contact with Christ. You find
Him to be the very Savior and friend you need. You
will see in Him what you have never seen before.</p>


<h4>Hunt For Something</h4>

<p>We must study the Bible thoroughly, and hunt it
through, as it were, for some great truth.</p>

<p>If a friend were to see me searching about a building,
and were to come up, and say, "Moody, what are you
looking for? Have you lost something?" and I were to
say, "No, I haven't lost anything; I'm not looking for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
anything particular," I fancy he would just let me go on
by myself, and think me very foolish. But if I were to
say, "Yes, I have lost a dollar," why, then, I might
expect him to help me to find it.</p>

<p>Read the Bible, my friends, as if you were seeking
for something of value. It is a good deal better to take
a single chapter, and spend a month on it, than to read
the Bible at random for a month.</p>


<h4>"When Ye Think Not"</h4>

<p>McCheyne, the Scotch preacher, once said to some
friends, "Do you think Christ will come to-night?"</p>

<p>One after another they said, "I think not."</p>

<p>When all had given this answer, he solemnly repeated
this text, "The Son of Man cometh at an hour <i>when ye
think not</i>."</p>


<h4>Home Piety</h4>

<p>If a Christian is unsound in patience or unsound in
love, we take no notice of it; but let him be unsound in
faith, and off goes his head. I do hate to see a minister
or professing Christian mean and peevish to his wife,
and yet be as polite as a dancing-master to other women.
I tell you he is not fit to preach the Word of God. I
don't want to have anything to do with him. The home
was established before the church, and he sadly needs
more home piety.</p>


<h4>Constant Watching</h4>

<p>The Persians had an annual festival when they slew
all the serpents and venomous creatures they could find;
but they allowed them to swarm as fast and freely as
ever until the festival came round once more. It was
poor policy. Sins, like serpents, breed quickly, and
need to be constantly watched.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>
<h4>The Wrong Physician</h4>

<p>I heard once of a man who went to England from the
Continent, and brought letters with him to eminent physicians
from the Emperor. The letters said:</p>

<p>"This man is a personal friend of mine, and we are
afraid he is going to lose his reason. Do all you can for
him."</p>

<p>The doctor asked him if he had lost any dear friend
in his own country, or any position of importance, or
what it was that was weighing on his mind.</p>

<p>The young man said: "No; but my father and grandfather
and myself were brought up infidels, and for the
last two or three years this thought has been haunting
me, 'Where shall I spend eternity?' And the thought of
it follows me day and night."</p>

<p>The doctor said, "You have come to the wrong physician,
but I will tell you of One who can cure you"; and
he told him of Christ, and read to him the fifty-third
chapter of Isaiah, "With His stripes we are healed."</p>

<p>The young man said, "Doctor, do you believe that?"</p>

<p>The doctor told him he did, and prayed and wrestled
with him, and at last the clear light of Calvary shone on
his soul. He had settled the question in his own mind
at last, where he would spend eternity.</p>

<p>I ask you, sinner, to settle if now. It is for you to
decide. Shall it be with the saints and martyrs and
prophets, or in the dark caverns of hell, amidst blackness
and darkness forever? Make haste to be wise; for
"how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?"</p>


<h4>Seeking the Lost</h4>

<p>I remember, when we were in London, they found one
old woman who was eighty-five years old, and not a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Christian. After the worker had prayed, she made a
prayer herself:</p>

<p>"O Lord, I thank Thee for going out of Thy way to
find me."</p>

<p>He is all the time going out of His way to find the lost.</p>


<h4>He Got Time To Think</h4>

<p>I was once preaching on the text, "Be not deceived;
God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that
shall he also reap." No sooner had I read it than a man
stood right up in the audience and said:</p>

<p>"I don't believe it."</p>

<p>I said: "My friend, that doesn't change the fact.
Truth is truth, whether you believe it or not; and a lie
is a lie, whether you believe it or not."</p>

<p>He didn't want to believe it. When the meeting
broke up, an officer was at the door to arrest him. He
was tried and sent to the penitentiary for twelve months
for stealing. I really believe that when he got into his
cell, he believed that he had to reap what he sowed.</p>


<h4>The Motherless Child</h4>

<p>Once I heard of a little sick child, whose mother was
seriously ill; and so, in order that she might have quiet,
and that the sick child might be no trouble to her, the
little one was taken away to a friend's house, and placed
in charge of a kind lady for a time. The mother grew
worse, and at length died. The father said:</p>

<p>"We'll not trouble the child about it; she is too
young to remember her mother; just let her remain
where she is until the funeral is over."</p>

<p>This was done, and in a few days the little girl was
brought back to the house. No mention was made of
her mother, or of what had occurred; but no sooner was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
she taken to the house than she ran first into one room,
then into another, into the parlor, the dining-room, and
all over the house, and then away into a little room
where her mother used to go to pray alone.</p>

<p>"Where is mother?" she cried. "I want mother!"</p>

<p>And when they were compelled to tell her what had
happened, she cried out:</p>

<p>"Take me away, take me away; I don't want to be
here without mother."</p>

<p>It was the mother made it home to her. And so it
is in heaven. It is not so much the white robes, the
golden crown, or the harps of gold, but it is the society
we shall meet there. Who, then, are there? What company
shall we have when we get there? Jesus is there,
the Holy Father is there, the Spirit is there&mdash;our Father,
our elder Brother, our Comforter.</p>


<h4>Converted the Regular Way</h4>

<p>I never yet knew a man converted just in the time
and manner he expected to be. I have heard people
say, "Well, if ever I am converted, it won't be in a
Methodist church; you won't catch me there." I never
knew a man say that but, at last, if converted at all, it
was in a Methodist church.</p>

<p>In Scotland a man was converted at one of our meetings&mdash;an
employer. He was very anxious that all his
employ&eacute;s should be reached, and he used to send them
one by one to the meetings. But there was one employ&eacute;
that wouldn't come. We are all more or less
troubled with stubbornness; and the moment this man
found that his employer wanted him to go to the meetings,
he made up his mind he wouldn't go. If he was
going to be converted, he said, he was going to be con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>verted
by some ordained minister; he was not going to
any meeting that was conducted by unordained Americans.
He believed in conversion, but he was going to be
converted the regular way. He believed in the regular
Presbyterian Church of Scotland, and that was the
place for him to be converted.</p>

<p>The employer tried every way he could to get him to
attend the meetings, but he wouldn't come.</p>

<p>After we left that town and went away up to Inverness,
the employer had some business up there, and he
sent this employ&eacute; to attend to it, in the hope that he
would attend some of our meetings.</p>

<p>One night, as I was preaching on the bank of a river,
I happened to take for my text the words of Naaman:
"I thought; I thought." I was trying to take men's
thoughts up and to show the difference between their
thoughts and God's thoughts. This man happened to be
walking along the bank of the river. He saw a great
crowd, and heard some one talking, and he wondered to
himself what that man was talking about. He didn't
know who was there, so he drew up to the crowd, and
listened. He heard the sermon, and became convicted
and converted right there. Then he inquired who was
the preacher, and he found out it was the very man that
he said he would not hear&mdash;the man he disliked. The
very man he had been talking against was the very man
God used to convert him.</p>


<h4>Crazy from Sin</h4>

<p>I was once preaching in Chicago, and a woman who
was nearly out of her mind came to me. You know
there are some people who mock at religious meetings,
and say that religion drives people mad. It is <i>sin</i> that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
drives people mad. It is the want of Christ that sinks
people into despair.</p>

<p>This was the woman's story:</p>

<p>She had a family of children. One of her neighbors
had died, and her husband had brought home a little
child. She said, "I don't want the child," but her husband
said, "You must take it and look after it." She
said she had enough to do with her own, and she told
her husband to take that child away. But he would not.
She confessed that she tried to starve the child; but it
lingered on. One night it cried all night; I suppose it
wanted food. At last she took the clothes and threw
them over the child and smothered it. No one saw her;
no one knew anything about it. The child was buried.
Years had passed away, and she said:</p>

<p>"I hear the voice of that child day and night. It has
driven me nearly mad."</p>

<p>No one saw the act; but God saw it, and this retribution
followed it. History is full of these things. You
need not go to the Bible to find it out.</p>


<h4>Don't Swear!</h4>

<p>I was greatly amazed not long ago, in talking to a
man who thought he was a Christian, to find that once
in a while, when he got angry, he would swear. I said:
"My friend, I don't see how you can tear down with
one hand what you are trying to build up with the other.
I don't see how you can profess to be a child of God and
let those words come out of your lips."</p>

<p>He replied: "Mr. Moody, if you knew me, you would
understand. I have a very quick temper. I inherited
it from my father and mother, and it is uncontrollable
but my swearing comes only from the lips."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>When God said, "I will not hold him guiltless that
takes My name in vain," He meant what He said, and
I don't believe any one can be a true child of God who
takes the name of God in vain.</p>


<h4>The True Sheep Knows</h4>

<p>I tell you the true sheep know a true shepherd. I
got up in Scotland once and quoted a passage of Scripture
a little different from what it was in the Bible, and
an old woman crept up and said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Moody, you said&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>I might make forty misquotations in an ordinary
audience, and no one would tell me about them. Like
two lawyers: one said in court that the other didn't know
the Lord's Prayer. The other said he did:</p>

<p>"Now I lay me down to sleep."</p>

<p>"Well," the first said, "I give it up. I did not think
you knew it."</p>

<p>Didn't either one of them know it, you see.</p>


<h4>The Father Knew Best</h4>

<p>Dr. Arnot, one of the greatest Scotch divines, was in
this country before he died. His mother died when he
was a little boy only three weeks old, and there was a
large family of Arnots. I suppose they missed the tenderness
and love of the mother. They got the impression
that their father was very stern and rigid, and that
he had a great many laws and rules.</p>

<p>One rule was, that the children should never climb
trees. When the neighbors found out that the Arnot
children could not climb trees, they began to tell them
about the wonderful things they could see from the tops
of the trees. Well, tell a boy of twelve years that he
mustn't climb a tree, and he will get up that tree some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
way. And so the Arnot children were all the time teasing
their father to let them climb the tree; but the old
sire said:</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>One day he was busy reading his paper, and the boys
said:</p>

<p>"Father is reading his paper. Let's slip down into
the lot and climb a tree."</p>

<p>One of the little fellows stood on the top of the fence
to see that father did not catch them. When his
brother got up on the first branch, he said:</p>

<p>"What do you see?"</p>

<p>"Why! I don't see anything."</p>

<p>"Then go higher; you haven't got high enough."</p>

<p>So up he went higher, and again the little boy asked:</p>

<p>"Well, what do you see now?"</p>

<p>"I don't see anything."</p>

<p>"You aren't high enough; go higher."</p>

<p>And the little fellow went up as high as he could go,
but he slipped, and down he came, and broke his leg.
Willie said he tried to get him into the house, but he
couldn't do it. He had to tell his father all about it.
He said he was scared nearly out of his wits. He thought
his father would be very angry. But his father just
threw aside the paper, and started for the lot. When
he got there, he picked the boy up in his arms, and
brought him up to the house. Then he sent for the doctor.
And Willie said he got a new view of that father.
He found out the reason why that father was so stern.
He said the moment that boy got hurt, no mother could
have been more loving and gentle.</p>

<p>My dear friends, there is not one commandment that
has been given us which has not been for our highest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
and best interest. There isn't a commandment that
hasn't come from the loving heart of God, and what He
wants is to have us give up that which is going to mar
our happiness in this life, and in the life to come.</p>


<h4>"Help Yourself!"</h4>

<p>When I was out on the Pacific coast, in California,
some years ago, I was the guest of a man that had a
large vineyard and a large orchard. One day he said to
me:</p>

<p>"Moody, while you are my guest I want you to make
yourself perfectly at home, and if there is anything in
the orchard or in the vineyard you would like, help
yourself."</p>

<p>Well, when I wanted an orange, I did not go to an
orange tree and pray the oranges to fall into my pocket;
but I walked up to a tree, reached out my hand, and
took the oranges. He said "Take," and I took.</p>

<p>God says, "There is my Son; take Him as your
Saviour. The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God
is eternal life."</p>


<h4>The Rich Husband</h4>

<p>There was a shop-girl in Chicago, a few years ago.
One day she could not have bought five dollars' worth of
anything; the next day she could go and buy a thousand
dollar's worth of whatever she wanted.</p>

<p>What made the difference?</p>

<p>Why, she had married a rich husband; that was all.
She had received him, and of course all he had became
hers. And so we can have all, if we only receive Christ.</p>


<h4>Settle It Now!</h4>

<p>Some years ago, in one of the mining districts of
England, a young man attended one of our meetings and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
refused to go from the place till he had found peace in
the Savior. The next day he went down into the pit,
and the coal fell in upon him. When they took him out,
he was broken and mangled, and had only two or three
minutes of life left in him. His friends gathered about
him, saw his lips moving, and, bending down to catch
his words, heard him say:</p>

<p>"It was a good thing I settled it last night."</p>

<p>Settle it now, my friends, once for all. Begin now to
confess your sins, and pray the Lord to remember you.
He will make you an heir of His kingdom, if you will
accept the gift of salvation.</p>


<h4>The True Source of Joy</h4>

<p>God doesn't ask us to rejoice over nothing; He gives
us ground for our joy. What would you think of a man
who seemed very happy to-day and full of joy, and
couldn't tell you what made him so? Suppose I should
meet a man on the street, and he was so full of joy that
he should get hold of both my hands and say:</p>

<p>"Bless the Lord, I am so full of joy!"</p>

<p>"What makes you so full of joy?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know."</p>

<p>"You don't know!"</p>

<p>"No, I don't; but I am so joyful that I just want to
get out of the flesh."</p>

<p>"What makes you feel so joyful?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know."</p>

<p>Would we not think such a person unreasonable? But
there are a great many people who want to feel that
they are Christians before they are Christians; they want
the Christian's experience before they become Christians;
they want to have the joy of the Lord before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
they receive Jesus Christ. But this is not the Gospel
order. He brings joy when He comes, and we cannot
have joy apart from Him. He is the author of it, and
we find our joy in Him.</p>


<h4>The Meanest Kind of Murderers</h4>

<p>When I was in England in 1892, I met a gentleman
who claimed that they were ahead of us in the respect
they had for the law. "We hang our murderers," he
said, "but there isn't one out of twenty in your country
that is hung."</p>

<p>I said, "You are greatly mistaken, for they walk
about these two countries unhung."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you what I mean," I said; "the man that
comes into my house and runs a dagger into my heart
for my money is a prince compared with a son that takes
five years to kill me and the wife of my bosom. A
young man who comes home night after night drunk, and
when his mother remonstrates, curses her gray hairs,
and kills her by inches, is the blackest kind of a murderer."</p>


<h4>Where your Treasure Is</h4>

<p>You can soon tell where a man's treasure is by his
talk. If it is in heaven, he will not be long with you
before he's talking about heaven; his heart is there, and
so his speech isn't long in running there, too. If his
heart is in money, he will soon have you deep in talk
about mines, speculation, stocks, bank rate, and so on.
If his heart is in lands, it won't be long before he's
talking about real estate, improvements, houses, and so
on. Always the same, wherever a man's heart is, there
his tongue will be sure to go.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>Some one in England said, if you see a man's goods
and furniture come down by the luggage train, you're
pretty sure he'll be down by the next passenger train;
he won't be long after; he'll follow his goods. And so
it is with heaven; if your treasure is on before you,
you'll be wanting to follow it; you'll be glad to be on
the road thither as soon as possible.</p>


<h4>Why his Life was Spared</h4>

<p>Two Americans who were crossing the Atlantic met
on Sunday night to sing hymns in the cabin. As they
sang the hymn, "Jesus, Lover of my Soul," one of them
heard an exceedingly rich and beautiful voice behind
him. He looked around, and although he did not know
the face he thought that he recognized the voice. So
when the music ceased he turned around and asked the
man if he had not been in the Civil War. The man
replied that he had been a Confederate soldier.</p>

<p>"Were you at such a place on such a night?" asked
the first.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "and a curious thing happened that
night; this hymn recalled it to my mind. I was on
sentry duty on the edge of a wood. It was a dark night
and very cold, and I was a little frightened because the
enemy were supposed to be very near at hand. I felt
very homesick and miserable, and about midnight, when
everything was very still, I was beginning to feel very
weary and thought that I would comfort myself by praying
and singing a hymn. I remember singing this
hymn&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'All my trust on Thee is stayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All my help from Thee I bring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cover my defenceless head<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With the shadow of Thy wing.'<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
"After I had sung those words a strange peace came
down upon me, and through the long night I remember
having felt no more fear."</p>

<p>"Now," said the other man, "listen to my story. I
was a Union soldier, and was in the wood that night with
a party of scouts. I saw you standing up, although I
didn't see your face, and my men had their rifles
focused upon you waiting the word to fire, but when
you sang out&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Cover my defenceless head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the shadow of Thy wing.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I said, 'Boys, put down your rifles; we will go home.' I
couldn't kill you after that."</p>


<h4>The Sinner's Heart</h4>

<p>When I was in Dublin some years ago I got up to go
to an early meeting, and found the servants had not
opened the front door; so I pulled back a bolt, but I
could not get the door open. Then I turned a key, but
the door would not open. Then I found there was
another bolt at the top and another bolt at the bottom.
Still the door would not open. Then I found there was
a bar, and then I found a night-lock. In all I found
five or six different fastenings.</p>

<p>I am afraid that door represents every sinner's heart.
The door of his heart is double-locked, double-bolted,
and double-barred. Oh, my friends, pull back the bolts,
and let the King of glory in!</p>


<h4>Nothing Small</h4>

<p>There are a great many different ways of doing good.
A lady once visited a hospital, and noticed with what
pleasure the patients would smell and look at the flowers
sent to them. Said she:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"If I had known that a bunch of flowers would do so
much good, I would have sent some from home."</p>

<p>As soon as she got home, she sent some flowers out of
her garden. It was a little thing&mdash;a bouquet of flowers.
It might be a very insignificant work&mdash;very small; but if
it was done in the right spirit, God accepted it. A cup
of water given in His name is accepted as given to Himself.
Nothing that is done for God is small.</p>


<h4>An Anecdote about Tennyson</h4>

<p>It is said that Tennyson once asked an old Christian
woman if there was any news.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Tennyson," she replied, "there's only
one piece of news that I know, and that is&mdash;Christ died
for all men."</p>

<p>"That is old news, and good news, and new news,"
Tennyson responded.</p>


<h4>On Satan's Ground</h4>

<p>There is a legend that the Apostle John was much
distressed over the fall of a young convert. He summoned
Satan before him, and reproached him for ruining
so good a youth.</p>

<p>"I found your good youth on my ground," said Satan;
"so I took him."</p>

<p>The only safe course is to avoid temptation altogether.</p>


<h4>Two Bidding for the Soul</h4>

<p>There are two who are bidding for your soul and
mine&mdash;the Lord Jesus and Satan.</p>

<p>Satan bids, and he offers that which he cannot give.
He is a liar, and has been from the foundation of the
world. I pity the man who is living on the promises of
the devil. He will never satisfy. But the Lord Jesus is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
able to give all that He offers. And what does He offer?
He offers peace and joy and comfort that the world
knows not of. He offers eternal life in the kingdom of
God. He offers a seat in His mansions. We are to sit
with Him upon His throne.</p>

<p>May God help you to make a right choice! Make
up your mind you will not rest until the great question
of eternity is settled, until you have crossed the borderland,
and pressed into the kingdom of God.</p>


<h4>Tried and Proven</h4>

<p>I knew an old lady that marked in the margin of her
Bible, opposite the promises. T. P.; T. for "tried," and
P. for "proven." What we want is to try the Bible and
see if it is not true.</p>


<h4>The Prairie Fire</h4>

<p>Out in the Western country, in the autumn, when men
go hunting, and there has not been any rain for months,
sometimes the prairie grass catches fire, and there comes
up a very strong wind, and the flames just roll along
twenty feet high, and travel at the rate of thirty or
forty miles an hour, consuming man and beast. When
the hunters see it coming, what do they do? They know
they cannot run as fast as the fire can run. Not the
fleetest horse can escape. They just take a match and
light the grass around them, and let the flames sweep,
and then they get into the burnt district and stand safe.
They hear the flames roar as they come along, they see
death coming toward them, but they do not fear, they
do not tremble, because the fire has swept over the place
where they are, and there is no danger. There is nothing
for the fire to burn.</p>

<p>There is one mountain that the wrath of God has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
swept over&mdash;that is, Mount Calvary; and the fire spent
its fury upon the bosom of the Son of God. Take your
stand by the cross, and you will be safe for time and
eternity.</p>


<h4>Perfect Order</h4>

<p>A good many people are afraid of doing anything out
of the regular lines&mdash;of doing anything out of order.
Now, you will find perfect order in a cemetery. You
will find perfect order where there is death. Where
there is life you will find something out of order.</p>


<h4>Is your Soul Insured?</h4>

<p>"Pa," said a little boy as he climbed to his father's
knee, and looked into his face as earnestly as if he understood
the importance of the subject, "pa, is your soul
insured?"</p>

<p>"What are you thinking about, my son?" replied the
agitated father. "Why do you ask that question?"</p>

<p>"Why, pa, I heard Uncle George say that you had
your house insured, and your life insured; but he didn't
believe you had thought of your soul, and he was afraid
you would lose it; won't you get it insured right away?"</p>

<p>The father leaned his head on his hand, and was
silent. He owned broad acres of land that were covered
with a bountiful produce; his barns were even now filled
with plenty, his buildings were all well covered by insurance;
and as if that would not suffice for the maintenance
of his wife and only child in case of his decease, he had,
the day before, taken a life-policy for a large amount;
yet not one thought had he given to his own immortal
soul. On that which was to waste away and become
part and parcel of its native dust he had spared no
pains; but for that which was to live on and on through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the long ages of eternity he had made no provision.
"What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world
and lose his own soul?"</p>


<h4>Memory</h4>

<p>I have been twice at the point of death. I was
drowning once, and just as I was going down the third
time I was rescued. In the twinkling of an eye my
whole life came flashing across my mind. I cannot tell
you how it was. I cannot tell you how a whole life can
be crowded into a second of time; but everything I had
done from my earliest childhood&mdash;it all came flashing
across my mind. And I believe that when God touches
the secret spring of memory, every one of our sins will
come back, and if they have not been blotted out by the
blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, they will haunt us as
eternal ages roll on.</p>

<p>We talk about our forgetting, but we cannot forget if
God says "Remember." We talk about the recording
angel keeping the record of our life. I have an idea
that when we get to heaven, or into eternity, we will find
that recording angel has been ourselves. God will make
every one of us keep our own record; these memories
will keep the record, and when God shall say, "Son,
remember," it will all flash across our mind. It won't
be God who will condemn us; it will be ourselves. We
shall condemn ourselves, and we shall stand before God
speechless.</p>

<p>There is a man in prison. He has been there five
years. Ask that man what makes the prison so terrible
to him. Ask him if it is the walls and the iron gates&mdash;ask
him if it is his hard work, and he will tell you <i>no</i>; he
will tell you what makes the prison so terrible to him is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
<i>memory</i>; and I have an idea that if we got down into the
lost world, we would find that is what makes hell so terrible&mdash;the
remembrance that they once heard the Gospel,
that they once had Christ offered to them, that they
once had the privilege of being saved, but they made
light of the Gospel, they neglected salvation, they
rejected the offer of mercy, and now if they would
accept it they could not.</p>


<h4>Balaam's Ass</h4>

<p>A friend of mine was going back to Scotland, and he
heard a couple of these little modern philosophers discussing
the Bible. One said: "The Bible says that
Balaam's ass spoke. Now, I am a scientific man, and I
have taken the pains to examine an ass's mouth, and it
is so formed that it couldn't speak."</p>

<p>He was going to toss the whole Bible over because
Balaam's ass couldn't speak.</p>

<p>My friend said he stood it just as long as he could,
and finally he said:</p>

<p>"Ah, man, you make an ass, and I will make him
speak."</p>

<p>The idea that the God who made the ass couldn't
speak through his mouth! Did you ever hear such
stuff? And yet this was one of your modern philosophers!</p>


<h4>The Border Apple-Tree</h4>

<p>If you want real peace and rest to your soul, keep separate
from the world.</p>

<p>I remember when I was a boy in Northfield, right
near the old red schoolhouse there was an apple-tree
that bore the earliest apples of any tree in town. They
had a law in that town that fruit on a tree overhanging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the street belonged to the public, and any fruit on the
other side of the fence belonged to the property-holders.
Half that apple-tree was over in the street, and it got
more old brooms and brickbats and handles than any
other tree in town. We boys used to watch to see when
an apple was getting red. I never got a ripe apple from
that tree in my life, and I don't believe any one else ever
did. You never went by that tree that you didn't see a
lot of broom-handles and clubs up there.</p>

<p>Now, take a lot of Christians who want to live right
on the line, with one foot in the world and one foot in
the church. They get more clubs than any one else.
The world clubs them. They say, "I don't believe in
that man's religion." And the church clubs them.
They get clubs both sides. It is a good deal better to
keep just as far from the line as you can if you want
power.</p>


<h4>Bad Company</h4>

<p>A friend of mine said he had a beautiful canary bird;
he thought it was the sweetest singer they had ever had.
Spring came on, and he felt it was a pity to keep the
poor bird in the house, so he put it under a tree right in
front of his house. He said before he knew it a lot of
these little English sparrows got under that tree (and
you know they cannot sing any more than I can, and I
don't know one note from another), and went, "Chirp,
chirp, chirp." Before he knew it, that little canary had
lost all its sweet notes. It had got into bad company.</p>

<p>After he found out that he had made a mistake, he
took the bird into the house, but it kept up that "Chirp,
chirp, chirp." He bought another bird, but the canary
nearly ruined it. He said that bird never got back its
sweet notes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, don't you know lots of Christian people who
had a fine testimony several years ago, but they have
lost their witness, and all they do now is talk, talk, talk,
talk? Why? Because they are out of communion with
God, and have lost their witness.</p>


<h4>"Hitch On" and "Cut Behind"</h4>

<p>Some one tells of an incident that happened in a
New England town the other day. All the boys were
sleighing. A big sleigh&mdash;we call it a "pung" up there&mdash;was
being driven through the streets by an old man
who looked like Santa Claus. He was calling out to
the small boys to hitch on, for a pung is like a 'bus, it
always holds one more.</p>

<p>There were already about twenty rollicking boys
hitched on, when one little fellow dropped off behind.
He tried, but couldn't catch up again, and pretty soon
he began to look out for another chance for a ride. A
man's sleigh was standing near by, and the boy began
to eye the man. When the man in the sleigh started off,
the little fellow hitched on behind, and the man grabbed
his whip and struck him directly in the eye. It looked as
if the eye had been put out, but it wasn't.</p>

<p>Now, that's the way we go through this world. Some
say, "Hitch on, hitch on"; others, "Cut behind, cut
behind." The hitch-on people fill the churches, and the
cut-behind ones empty them.</p>


<h4>Known by Name</h4>

<p>A friend of mine was in Syria, and he found a shepherd
that kept up the old custom of naming his sheep. My
friend said he wouldn't believe that the sheep knew him
when he called them by name. So he said to the shepherd:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish you would just call one or two."</p>

<p>The shepherd said, "Carl."</p>

<p>The sheep stopped eating and looked up.</p>

<p>The shepherd called out, "Come here."</p>

<p>The sheep came, and stood looking up into his face.</p>

<p>He called another, and another, and there they stood
looking up at the shepherd.</p>

<p>"How can you tell them apart?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there are no two alike. See, that sheep toes in
a little; this sheep is a little bit squint-eyed; that sheep
has a black spot on its nose."</p>

<p>My friend found that he knew every one of his sheep
by their failings. He didn't have a perfect one in his
flock.</p>

<p>I suppose that is the way the Lord knows you and me.
There is a man that is covetous; he wants to grasp
the whole world. He wants a shepherd to keep down
that spirit. There is a woman down there who has an
awful tongue; she keeps the whole neighborhood stirred
up. There is a woman over there who is deceitful, terribly
so. She needs the care of a shepherd to keep her
from deceit, for she will ruin all her children; they will
all turn out just like their mother. There is a father
over there who wouldn't swear for all the world before
his children, but sometimes he gets provoked in his business
and swears before he knows it. Doesn't he need a
shepherd's care? I would like to know if there is a man
or woman on earth who doesn't need the care of a shepherd.
Haven't we all got failings? If you really want
to know what your failings are, you can find some one
who can point them out. God would never have sent
Christ into the world if we didn't need His care. We
are as weak and foolish as sheep.</p>

<h4>The Right Time for Action</h4>

<p>A man was always telling his servant that he was
going to do a great thing for him. "I am going to
remember you in my will."</p>

<p>Sambo got his expectations up very high. When the
man came to die, it was found that all he had willed
Sambo was to be buried in the family lot. That was
the big thing, you know. Sambo said he wished he had
given him ten dollars, and let the lot go.</p>

<p>If you want to show kindness to a person, show it to
him while you are living. I heard a man say that he
didn't want people to throw bouquets to him after he
was dead, and say, "There, smell them."</p>

<p>Now, this is the time for action. I have got so tired
and sick of this splitting hairs over theology. Man, let
us go out and get the fallen up. Lift them up toward
God and heaven. We want a practical kind of Christianity.</p>


<h4>Criticising the Sermon</h4>

<p>Very often a man will hear a hundred good things in
a sermon, but there may be one thing that strikes him
as a little out of place, and he will go home and sit
down at the table and talk right out before his children
and magnify that one wrong thing, and not say a word
about the hundred good things that were said. That is
what people do who criticise.</p>


<h4>A Reminiscence</h4>

<p>I remember blaming my mother for sending me to
church on the Sabbath. On one occasion the preacher
had to send some one into the gallery to wake me up.
I thought it was hard to have to work in the field all the
week, and then be obliged to go to church and hear a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
sermon I didn't understand. I thought I wouldn't go to
church any more when I got away from home; but I had
got so in the habit of going that I couldn't stay away.
After one or two Sabbaths, back again to the house of
God I went. There I first found Christ, and I have
often said since:</p>

<p>"Mother, I thank you for making me go to the house
of God when I didn't want to go."</p>


<h4>Transplanting the Lily</h4>

<p>"It is easy to go when the time comes. There are no
ropes thrown out to pull us ashore; there are no ladders
let down to pull us up. Christ comes and takes us by
the hand, and says:</p>

<p>"'You have had enough of this. Come up higher!'</p>

<p>"Do you hurt a lily when you pluck it? Is there any
rudeness when Jesus touches the cheek, and the red
rose of health whitens into the lily of immortal purity
and gladness?"&mdash;Talmage.</p>


<h4>Election</h4>

<p>How many men fold their arms and say:</p>

<p>"If I am one of the elect, I will be saved, and if I
ain't, I won't. No use of your bothering about it."</p>

<p>Why don't some of these merchants say: "If God is
going to make me a successful merchant in Chicago, I
will be one whether I like it or not, and if He isn't
I won't."</p>

<p>If you are sick, and a doctor prescribes for you, don't
take the medicine&mdash;throw it out the door. It does not
matter, for if God has decreed you are going to die, you
will; if He hasn't, you will get better. If you use that
argument you may as well not walk home from this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
tabernacle. If God has said you'll get home, you'll get
home&mdash;you'll fly through the air.</p>

<p>I have an idea that the Lord Jesus saw how men were
going to stumble over this doctrine, so after He had
been thirty or forty years in heaven He came down and
spoke to John. One Lord's day in Patmos, He said to
him:</p>

<p>"Write these things to the churches."</p>

<p>John kept on writing. His pen flew very fast. And
then the Lord, when it was nearly finished, said, "John,
before you close the book, put in one more invitation.
'The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that
heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst, come.
And <span class="smcap">WHOSOEVER WILL</span>, let him take the water of life
freely.'"</p>


<h4>The Mysteries of the Bible</h4>

<p>Dr. Talmage tells the story that one day while he was
bothering his theological professor with questions about
the mysteries of the Bible, the latter turned on him
and said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Talmage, you will have to let God know some
things you don't."</p>


<h4>The Little Lone One</h4>

<p>I sometimes think if an angel were to wing its way to
heaven, and tell them that there was one little child here
on earth&mdash;it might be a shoeless, coatless street Arab&mdash;with
no one to lead it to the cross of Christ, and if God
were to call the angels round His throne and ask them
to go and spend&mdash;aye, fifty years, in teaching that child,
there would not be an angel in heaven but would respond
gladly to the appeal. We should see even Gabriel saying,
"Let me go and win that soul to Christ." We
should see Paul buckling on his old armor again, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
saying, "Let me go back again to earth, that I may have
the joy of leading that little one to his Saviour."</p>

<p>Ah! we need rousing; there is too much apathy
amongst professing Christians. Let us pray God that
He may send His Holy Spirit to inspire us with fresh
energy and zeal to do His work.</p>


<h4>Doubting Castle</h4>

<p>It is the privilege of every child of God to know that
he is saved, and yet I find ever so many people living in
Doubting Castle. Why, it is <i>salvation by doubts</i> nowadays,
instead of <i>by faith;</i> there are so few that dare to
say, "I know that my Redeemer liveth; I know in whom
I have believed." We find most Christians nowadays
shivering and trembling from head to foot&mdash;they do not
know whether they are saved or not.</p>


<h4>Faith</h4>

<p>Bishop Ryle has very well likened faith to a root
whose flower is assurance. To have the latter, he says,
it is necessary that there must first be the hidden source
of faith.</p>

<p>Faith is the simplest and most universal experience in
the world. Call it by whatever name you may, confidence,
trust, or belief, it is inseparable from the human
race. The first sign of a dawning intelligence in the
mind is the exercise of the infant's faith toward those it
knows, and its fear toward those it does not know. We
cannot even remember when we first began to have faith.</p>


<h4>Confessing Christ at Home</h4>

<p>I was preaching in Chicago to a hall full of women
one Sunday afternoon, and after the meeting was over a
lady came to me and said she wanted to talk to me. She
said she would accept Christ, and after some conversa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>tion
she went home. I looked for her for a whole week,
but didn't see her until the following Sunday afternoon.
She came and sat down right in front of me, and her
face had such a sad expression. She seemed to have
entered into the misery, instead of the joy, of the Lord.</p>

<p>After the meeting was over I went to her and asked
her what the trouble was.</p>

<p>She said, "Oh, Mr. Moody, this has been the most
miserable week of my life."</p>

<p>I asked her if there was any one with whom she had
had trouble and whom she could not forgive.</p>

<p>She said, "No, not that I know of."</p>

<p>"Well, did you tell your friends about having found
the Saviour?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I didn't. I have been all the week trying to
keep it from them."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "that is the reason why you have no
peace."</p>

<p>She wanted to take the crown, but did not want the
cross. My friends, you must go by the way of Calvary.
If you ever get peace and joy you must get it at the foot
of the cross.</p>

<p>"Why," she said, "if I should go home and tell my
infidel husband that I had found Christ, I don't know
what he would do. I think he would turn me out."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "go out."</p>

<p>She went away, promising that she would tell him,
timid and pale, but she did not want another wretched
week. She was bound to have peace.</p>

<p>The next night I gave a lecture to men only, and in
the hall there were eight thousand men and one solitary
woman. When I got through and went into the inquiry
meeting I found this lady with her husband. She intro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>duced
him to me (he was a doctor and a very influential
man), and said:</p>

<p>"He wants to become a Christian."</p>

<p>I took my Bible and told him all about Christ,
and he accepted Him. I said to her after it was all
over:</p>

<p>"It turned out quite differently from what you
expected, didn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied; "I was never so scared in my
life. I expected he would do something dreadful, but it
has turned out so well."</p>

<p>She took God's way, and got the joy and peace she
sought.</p>


<h4>How to Settle the Theater Question</h4>

<p>A lady came to me once and said, "Mr. Moody, I
wish you would tell me how I can become a Christian."
The tears were rolling down her cheeks, and she was in
a very favorable mood. "But," she said, "I don't want to
be one of your kind."</p>

<p>"Well," I asked, "have I got any peculiar kind?
What is the matter with my Christianity?"</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "my father was a doctor, and had
a large practice, and he used to get so tired that he used
to take us to the theater. There was a large family of
girls, and we had tickets for the theaters three or four
times a week. I suppose we were there a good deal
oftener than we were in church. I am married to a
lawyer, and he has a large practice. He gets so tired
that he takes us out to the theater," and she said, "I
am far better acquainted with the theater and theater
people than with the church and church people, and I
don't want to give up the theater."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "did you ever hear me say anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
about theaters? There have been reporters here every
day for all the different papers, and they are giving my
sermons verbatim in one paper. Have you ever seen
anything in the sermons against the theaters?"</p>

<p>She said, "No."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "I have seen you in the audience
every afternoon for several weeks, and have you heard
me say anything against theaters?"</p>

<p>No, she hadn't.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "what made you bring them up?"</p>

<p>"Why, I supposed you didn't believe in theaters."</p>

<p>"What made you think that?"</p>

<p>"Why," she said, "do you ever go?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why don't you go?"</p>

<p>"Because I have got something better. I would
sooner go out into the street and eat dirt than do some
of the things I used to do before I became a Christian."</p>

<p>"Why!" she said; "I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Never mind," I said. "When Jesus Christ has the
pre&euml;minence, you will understand it all. He didn't come
down here and say we shouldn't go here and we shouldn't
go there, and lay down a lot of rules, but He laid down
great principles. Now, He says if you love Him you
will take delight in pleasing Him." And I began to
preach Christ to her. The tears started again. She
said:</p>

<p>"I tell you, Mr. Moody, that sermon on the indwelling
Christ yesterday afternoon just broke my heart. I admire
Him, and I want to be a Christian, but I don't
want to give up the theaters."</p>

<p>I said, "Please don't mention them again. I don't
want to talk about theaters. I want to talk to you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
about Christ." So I took my Bible, and I read to her
about Christ.</p>

<p>But she said again, "Mr. Moody, can I go to the theater
if I become a Christian?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "you can go to the theater just as
much as you like if you are a real, true Christian, and
can go with His blessing."</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "I am glad you are not so narrow-minded
as some."</p>

<p>She felt quite relieved to think that she could go to
the theaters and be a Christian. But I said:</p>

<p>"If you can go to the theater for the glory of God,
keep on going; only be sure that you go for the glory of
God. If you are a Christian you will be glad to do
whatever will please Him."</p>

<p>I really think she became a Christian that day. The
burden had gone, there was joy; but just as she was
leaving me at the door she said:</p>

<p>"I am not going to give up the theater."</p>

<p>In a few days she came back to me and said: "Mr.
Moody, I understand all about that theater business
now. I went the other night. There was a large party
at our house, and my husband wanted us to go, and we
went; but when the curtain lifted everything looked so
different. I said to my husband, 'This is no place for
me; this is horrible. I am not going to stay here, I am
going home.' He said, 'Don't make a fool of yourself.
Every one has heard that you have been converted in
the Moody meetings, and if you go out it will be all
through fashionable society. I beg of you don't make
a fool of yourself by getting up and going out.' But I
said, 'I have been making a fool of myself all of my life.'"</p>

<p>Now, the theater hadn't changed, but she had got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
something better, and she was going to overcome the
world. "They that are after the flesh do mind the
things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit,
the things of the Spirit." When Christ has the first
place in your heart you are going to get victory. Just
do whatever you know will please Him. The great
objection I have to these things is that they get the
mastery, and become a hindrance to spiritual growth.</p>


<h4>What a Sister Can Do</h4>

<p>I want to say to young ladies, perhaps you have a
godless father or mother, or a skeptical brother, who is
going down through drink, and perhaps there is no one
who can reach them but you. How many times a godly,
pure young lady has taken the light into some darkened
home! Many a home might be lit up with the Gospel if
the mothers and daughters would only speak the word.</p>

<p>The last time Mr. Sankey and myself were in Edinburgh,
there were a father, two sisters, and a brother,
who used every morning to take the morning paper and
pick my sermon to pieces. They were indignant to
think that the Edinburgh people should be carried away
with such preaching. One day one of the sisters was
going by the hall, and she thought she would drop in and
see what class of people went there. She happened to
take a seat by a godly lady, who said to her:</p>

<p>"I hope you are interested in this work,"</p>

<p>She tossed her head and said: "Indeed I am not.
I am disgusted with everything I have seen and heard."</p>

<p>"Well," said the lady, "perhaps you came prejudiced."</p>

<p>"Yes, and the meeting has not removed any of it, but
has rather increased it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have received a great deal of good from them."</p>

<p>"There is nothing here for me. I don't see how an
intellectual person can be interested."</p>

<p>To make a long story short, she got the young lady
to promise to come back. When the meeting broke up,
just a little of the prejudice had worn away. She promised
to come back again the next day, and then she
attended three or four more meetings, and became quite
interested. She said nothing to her family, until finally
the burden became too heavy, and she told them. They
laughed at her, and made her the butt of their ridicule.</p>

<p>One day the two sisters were together, and the other
said, "Now what have you got at those meetings that
you didn't have in the first place?"</p>

<p>"I have a peace that I never knew of before. I am
at peace with God, myself, and all the world." Did you
ever have a little war of your own with your neighbors,
in your own family? And she said: "I have self-control.
You know, sister, if you had said half the mean things
before I was converted that you have said since, I would
have been angry and answered back, but if you remember
correctly, I haven't answered once since I have been
converted."</p>

<p>The sister said, "You certainly have something that
I have not."</p>

<p>The other told her it was for her, too, and she brought
the sister to the meetings, where she found peace.</p>

<p>Like Martha and Mary, they had a brother but he
was a member of the University of Edinburgh. He be
converted? He go to these meetings? It might do for
women, but not for him! One night they came home
and told him that a chum of his own, a member of the
university, had stood up and confessed Christ, and when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
he sat down his brother got up and confessed; and so
with the third one.</p>

<p>When the young man heard it, he said: "Do you
mean to tell me that he has been converted?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "there must be something in it."</p>

<p>He put on his hat and coat, and went to see his friend
Black. Black got him down to the meetings, and he
was converted.</p>

<p>We went through to Glasgow, and had not been there
six weeks when news came that that young man had been
stricken down, and had died. When he was dying he
called his father to his bedside and said:</p>

<p>"Wasn't it a good thing that my sisters went to those
meetings? Won't you meet me in heaven, father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my son, I am so glad you are a Christian; that
is the only comfort that I have in losing you. I will
become a Christian, and will meet you again."</p>

<p>I tell this to encourage some sister to go home and
carry the message of salvation. It may be that your
brother may be taken away in a few months.</p>


<h4>How one Man Treated Doubts</h4>

<p>A wild and prodigal young man, who was running a
headlong career to ruin came into one of our meetings
in Chicago. Whilst endeavoring to bring him to Christ,
I quoted this verse to him: "Him that cometh unto me
I will in no wise cast out."</p>

<p>I asked him: "Do you believe Christ said that?"</p>

<p>"I suppose He did."</p>

<p>"Suppose He did! do you believe it?"</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>"Hope so! do you believe it? You do your work,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
and the Lord will do His. Just come as you are, and
throw yourself upon His bosom, and He will not cast
you out."</p>

<p>This man thought it was too simple and easy.</p>

<p>At last light seemed to break in upon him, and he
seemed to find comfort from it. It was past midnight
before he got down on his knees, but down he went, and
was converted. I said:</p>

<p>"Now, don't think you are going to get out of the
devil's territory without trouble. The devil will come
to you to-morrow morning and say it was all feeling;
that you only imagined you were accepted by God.
When he does, don't fight him with your own opinions,
but fight him with John vi. 37: 'Him that cometh to Me
I will in nowise cast out.' Let that be 'the sword of the
Spirit.'"</p>

<p>I don't believe that any man ever starts to go to
Christ but the devil strives somehow or other to meet
him and trip him up. And even after he has come to
Christ, the devil tries to assail him with doubts, and
make him believe there is something wrong in it.</p>

<p>The struggle came sooner than I thought in this man's
case. When he was on his way home the devil assailed
him. He used this text, but the devil put this thought
into his mind:</p>

<p>"How do you know Christ ever said that after all?
Perhaps the translators made a mistake."</p>

<p>Into darkness he went again. He was in trouble till
about two in the morning. At last he came to this conclusion.
Said he:</p>

<p>"I will believe it anyway; and when I get to heaven,
if it isn't true, I will just tell the Lord <i>I</i> didn't make
the mistake&mdash;the translators made it."</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>
<h4>Use or Lose</h4>

<p>An Eastern allegory runs thus: A merchant, going
abroad for a time, gave respectively to two of his friends
two sacks of wheat each, to take care of against his
return. Years passed. When he came back, he applied
for them again.</p>

<p>The first took him into a storehouse, and showed
him his sacks; but they were mildewed and worthless.</p>

<p>The other led him out into the open country, and
pointed to field after field of waving wheat, the produce
of the two sacks given him.</p>

<p>Said the merchant: "You have been a faithful friend.
Give me two sacks of that wheat; the rest shall be thine."</p>

<p>Let us put to good use the talents God has given us.</p>


<h4>The Anchored Boat</h4>

<p>I once heard of two men who were under the influence
of liquor. They came down at night to where their
boat was tied. They wanted to return home, so they
got in and began to row. They pulled away hard all
night, wondering why they never got to the other side of
the bay. When the gray dawn of morning broke,
behold! they had never loosed the mooring line or raised
the anchor!</p>

<p>That's just the way with many who are striving to
enter the kingdom of heaven. They cannot believe,
because they are tied to this world. Cut the cord!
Confess and forsake your sins! Cut the cord! Set yourselves
free from the clogging weight of earthly things,
and you will soon rise heavenward.</p>


<h4>Not Much up There</h4>

<p>A friend of mine was once taken by an old man to
see his riches. He took him to a splendid mansion, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
said, "This is all mine." He pointed to a little town,
"That is mine; it is called by my name." He pointed
to a rolling prairie, "That is all mine; the sun never
shone on a finer prairie than that, so fruitful and rich,
and it's all mine." In another direction he showed him
fertile farms extending for thirty miles, "These are all
mine." He took him into his grand house, showed him
his beautiful pictures, his costly gold plate, his jewels,
and still he said, "These are all mine. This grand hall
I have built; it is called by my name; there is my
insignia on it. And yet I was once a poor boy. I have
made it all myself."</p>

<p>My friend looked at him. "Well, you've all this on
earth; but what have you got up there?"</p>

<p>"Up where?" said the old man.</p>

<p>"Up in heaven."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm afraid I haven't got much up there."</p>

<p>"Ah," said my friend, "but you've got to die, to
leave this world; what will you take with you of all these
things? You will die a beggar; for all these riches
count as nothing in the kingdom of heaven. You will
be a pauper; for you have no inheritance with the saints
above." The poor old man (he was poor enough in
reality, though rich in all the world's goods) burst into
tears. He had no hope for the future. In four months'
time he was dead; and where is he now? He lived and
died without God, and without hope in this world or the
next.</p>


<h4>Touching the Spot</h4>

<p>When a man has broken his arm, the surgeon must
find out the exact spot where the fracture is. He feels
along and presses gently with his fingers.</p>

<p>"Is it there?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"No,"</p>

<p>"Is it there?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Presently, when the surgeon touches another spot,
"Ouch!" says the man.</p>

<p>He has found the broken part, and it hurts.</p>

<p>It is one thing to hear a man preach down other people's
sins. Men will say, "That is splendid," and will
want all their friends to go and hear the preacher. But
let him touch on their individual sin, and declare, as
Nathan did to David, "Thou art the man," and they
say, "I do not like that." The preacher has touched a
sore place.</p>


<h4>The Little Boy and the Big Book</h4>

<p>I like to think of Christ as a burden bearer.</p>

<p>A minister was one day moving his library upstairs.
As he was going up with a load of books, his little
boy came in, and was very anxious to help his father.
So his father just told him to go and get an armful, and
bring them upstairs. When the father came back, he met
the little fellow about half-way up, tugging away at
the biggest book in the library. He couldn't manage
to carry it up. It was too big. So he sat down and
cried.</p>

<p>His father found him, and just took him in his arms,
book and all, and carried him upstairs. So Christ will
carry you and all your burdens, if you will but let Him.</p>


<h4>The Invitation to a Saloon Opening</h4>

<p>They were going to have a great celebration at the
opening of a saloon and billiard hall in Chicago, in the
northern part of the city, where I lived. It was to be a
gateway to death and to hell, one of the worst places in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Chicago. As a joke they sent me an invitation to go to
the opening. I took the invitation, and went down and
saw the two men who had the saloon, and I said:</p>

<p>"Is that a genuine invitation?"</p>

<p>They said it was.</p>

<p>"Thank you," I said; "I will be around, and if there
is anything here I don't like I may have something to
say about it."</p>

<p>They said, "You are not going to <i>preach</i>, are you?"</p>

<p>"I may."</p>

<p>"We don't want you. We won't let you in."</p>

<p>"How are you going to keep me out?" I asked.
"There is the invitation."</p>

<p>"We will put a policeman at the door."</p>

<p>"What is the policeman going to do with that invitation?"</p>

<p>"We won't let you in."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "I will be there."</p>

<p>I gave them a good scare, and then I said, "I will
compromise the matter; if you two men will get down
here and let me pray with you, I will let you off."</p>

<p>I got those two rum-sellers down on their knees, one
on one side of me and the other on the other side, and
I prayed God to save their souls and smite their business.
One of them had a Christian mother, and he
seemed to have some conscience left. After I had
prayed, I said:</p>

<p>"How can you do this business? How can you throw
this place open to ruin the young men of Chicago?"</p>

<p>Within three months the whole thing smashed up, and
one of them was converted shortly after. I have never
been invited to a saloon since.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>
<h4>"Too Late!"</h4>

<p>At our church in Chicago I was closing the meeting
one day, when a young soldier got up and entreated the
people to decide for Christ at once. He said he had
just come from a dark scene. A comrade of his, who had
enlisted with him, had a father who was always entreating
him to become a Christian, and in reply he always
said he would when the war was over. At last he was
wounded, and was put into the hospital, but got worse,
and was gradually sinking. One day, a few hours before
he died, a letter came from his sister, but he was too far
gone to read it. It was such an earnest letter! The
comrade read it to him, but he did not seem to understand
it, he was so weak, till it came to the last sentence,
which said:</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear brother, when you get this letter, will
you not accept your sister's Savior?"</p>

<p>The dying man sprang up from his cot, and said,
"What do you say? what do you say?" And then, falling
back on his pillow, feebly exclaimed, "<i>It is too late! It
is too late!</i>"</p>

<p>My dear friends, thank God it is not <i>too late</i> for you
to-day. The Master is still calling you. Let every one
of us, young and old, rich and poor, come to Christ at
once, and He will put all our sins away. Don't wait
any longer for feeling, but obey at once. You can
believe, you can trust, you can lay hold on eternal life, if
you will. Will you not do it now?</p>

<h4>PSALM 23.</h4>

<p>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall
not want.</p>

<p>2 He maketh me to lie down in
green pastures: he leadeth me beside
the still waters.</p>

<p>3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth
me in the paths of righteousness for
his name's sake.</p>

<p>4 Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death, I will
fear no evil: for thou art with me;
thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</p>

<p>5 Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies; thou
anointest my head with oil; my cup
runneth over.</p>

<p>6 Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life: and
I will dwell in the house of the Lord
forever.</p>


<h4>ISAIAH 55: 1&mdash;7.</h4>

<p>Ho, every one that thirsteth, come
ye to the waters, and he that hath
no money; come ye, buy and eat; yea,
come, buy wine and milk without
money and without price.</p>

<p>2 Wherefore do ye spend money for
that which is not bread? and your
labour for that which satisfieth not?
hearken diligently unto me, and eat
ye that which is good, and let your
soul delight itself in fatness.</p>

<p>3 Incline your ear, and come unto
me: hear, and your soul shall live;
and I will make an everlasting covenant
with you, even the sure mercies
of David.</p>

<p>4 Behold, I have given him for a
witness to the people, a leader and
commander to the people.</p>

<p>5 Behold, thou shalt call a nation
that thou knowest not, and nations
that knew not thee shall run unto
thee, because of the Lord thy God,
and for the Holy One of Israel; for he
hath glorified thee.</p>

<p>6 Seek ye the Lord while he may
be found, call ye upon him while he
is near:</p>

<p>7 Let the wicked forsake his way,
and the unrighteous man his thoughts:
and let him return unto the Lord, and
he will have mercy upon him; and to
our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</p>


<h4>JOHN 3: 1&mdash;16.</h4>

<p>There was a man of the Pharisees,
named Nicodemus, a ruler of the
Jews:</p>

<p>2 The same came to Jesus by night,
and said unto him, Rabbi, we know
that thou art a teacher come from
God; for no man can do these miracles
that thou doest, except God be with
him.</p>

<p>3 Jesus answered and said unto him,
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except
a man be born again, he cannot see
the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How
can a man be born when he is old?
can he enter the second time into his
mother's womb, and be born?</p>

<p>5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I
say unto thee, Except a man be born
of water and of the Spirit, he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>6 That which is born of the flesh is
flesh; and that which is born of the
Spirit is spirit.</p>

<p>7 Marvel not that I said unto thee,
Ye must be born again.</p>

<p>8 The wind bloweth where it listeth,
and thou hearest the sound thereof,
but canst not tell whence it cometh,
and whither it goeth; so is every one
that is born of the Spirit.</p>

<p>9 Nicodemus answered and said unto
him, How can these things be?</p>

<p>10 Jesus answered and said unto
him, Art thou a master of Israel, and
knowest not these things?</p>

<p>11 Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
We speak that we do know, and testify
that we have seen; and ye receive not
our witness.</p>

<p>12 If I have told you earthly things,
and ye believe not, how shall ye believe,
if I tell you of heavenly things?</p>

<p>13 And no man hath ascended up
to heaven, but he that came down
from heaven, even the Son of man
which is in heaven.</p>

<p>14 And as Moses lifted up the
serpent in the wilderness, even so
must the Son of man be lifted up:</p>

<p>15 That whosoever believeth in him
should not perish, but have eternal life.</p>

<p>16 For God so loved the world, that
he gave his only begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth in him should
not perish, but have everlasting life.</p>

<h2>LIFE on the HIGHEST PLANE</h2>

<h4><i>By</i> <span class="smcap">Ruth Paxson</span><br />
Now, all 3 volumes in one book. 820 pages, <b>$3.00</b></h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 20%;">
<img src="images/books.jpg" width="100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The three volumes, "<span class="smcap">The Person and
Work of Christ</span>"; "<span class="smcap">The Relation Between
Christ and the Christian</span>"; and
"<span class="smcap">The Believer's Response to the Holy
Spirit's Inworking</span>" have now been combined,
without revision and with fourteen
colored charts included in one handy volume.</p>

<p>These Bible studies were first given in
embryo to pastors, evangelists, teachers, and
other Christian leaders in conferences held
in China. Later, printed in three volumes,
they brought great blessing to many.</p></div>


<h3>Other Books By Ruth Paxson</h3>

<h4>GOD'S PLAN OF REDEMPTION</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It will aid one in personal Bible study or provide a practical outline for
study groups. The questions are based on the teaching in each chapter of
"Life on the Highest Plane." Can be used with or without the larger book.
48 pages, paper, <b>25c.</b></p></div>

<h4>CALLED UNTO HOLINESS</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Addresses given at Keswick's Conference in England. Sounds the clarion call
to a more holy life. Here is victory for the defeated; deliverance for the enslaved;
rest for the weary; peace for the discouraged; and joy for the sorrowing.
126 pages, paper, <b>20c.</b></p></div>

<h4>RIVERS OF LIVING WATER</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Studies Setting Forth the Believer's Possession of Christ, How Obtained&mdash;How
Maintained. Multitudes of Christians are living a dry and thirsty existence
when the Lord is waiting to give them His very best&mdash;rivers of living
water! Perhaps few Christians have heard or read the Divine plan and purpose
for the life of the believer presented so tersely, simply and clearly, and withal
so lovingly and compellingly. 124 pages, paper, <b>20c.</b></p></div>

<h4>The WEALTH, WALK and WARFARE of the CHRISTIAN</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The author finds a "Grand Canyon of Scripture" in Ephesians. Her threefold
message to Christians will be especially welcome to those who are suffering
from spiritual or mental depression; those who are conscious of their unworthiness,
failure and defeat; those who are passing through terrible attacks
of Satan. 223 pages, cloth, <b>$1.50.</b></p></div>
